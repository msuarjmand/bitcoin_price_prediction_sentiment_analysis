0,"Bitcoin (BTC) adoption by big-money players is once again on the agenda following the recent $250 million BTC purchase by MicroStrategy. Industry commentators have also stated that corporations plugging into Bitcoin will provide prominent tailwinds to push BTC valuation to new heights.With the coronavirus pandemic adversely impacting economies around the globe, investors appear to be looking toward safe haven assets. Indeed, the attention on both BTC and gold is causing a significant coupling of their respective price actions, given that central banks continue to pursue aggressive quantitative easing. With a firm like MicroStrategy hedging with Bitcoin, it appears this pivot might now spread to Wall Street.Reports of the Trump administration looking to delay the collection of Social Security payroll taxes are also ringing alarm bells in the United States. The likely outcome of this executive order is more money being printed to fund the country’s social security, which consequently means further U.S. dollar debasement.Since the start of 2020, the number of addresses holding 0.01 BTC and 0.1 BTC has been climbing steadily, while data from market intelligence platform Glassnode claims the number of “wholecoiners” — wallets with at least 1 BTC — has also increased in 2020, all highlighting a consistent culture of “stacking sats” by various groups of investors. When the U.S. government sent stimulus payments to the public in April, Coinbase reported a spike in BTC purchase sums to the tune of $1,200 — the exact amount in the checks. The Bitcoin bought with $1,200 at the time is now worth over $1,600, resulting in gains made by BTC over a weakening USD during the period. Even when Bitcoin dipped to $3,800 during the “Black Thursday” market crash, exchanges reported an uptick in retail BTC buying. Platforms like Square’s CashApp are even taking advantage of the stacking sats culture, with features aimed at automating periodic micro BTC purchases. Studies show that dollar-cost averaging — the practice of dividing total investment across fixed intervals — assures positive returns for Bitcoin investors, irrespective of volatile price action. Thus, the events of 2020 so far suggest that Bitcoin is being viewed as a viable safe-haven asset. On Aug. 11, MicroStrategy — the world’s largest business intelligence firm — purchased 21,454 BTC, valued at $250 million. The move saw MicroStrategy swapping cash for BTC as its treasury reserve asset in what industry commentators say could be a watershed event for Bitcoin institutional adoption. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor echoed the sentiments espoused by many BTC proponents, stating in a press release: “Bitcoin is digital gold — harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it.”Saylor’s comments offer a snapshot of how Bitcoin’s perception on Wall Street appears to be changing. Back in December 2013, when one BTC was worth $520, the MicroStrategy CEO was not sold on its value proposition: #Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.Indeed, 2020 has seen Wall Street figures taking a significant interest in Bitcoin. Billionaire hedge fund investor Paul Tudor Jones revealed back in May that 1% of his total assets in BTC are a hedge against inflation, tipping Bitcoin to become the de-facto leader in the emerging global financial landscape. Despite dismissing BTC as an investment asset earlier in the year, Goldman Sachs is reportedly looking into client requests for cryptocurrencies in another 180-degree turn.Brian Kerr, CEO of DeFi banking service Kava Labs, told Cointelegraph that businesses now more than ever need robust risk-management planning: “It’s the job of every corporate’s finance department to manage risk.” He added, “It’s a bit irresponsible of treasury departments if they are not considering Bitcoin to hedge risks of their assets.” Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of crypto exchange platform CEX.IO, highlighted to Cointelegraph the implications of a listed company investing in Bitcoin:“What is really important here is that a listed company with strict requirements for financial diligence to the shareholders has taken a substantial position in BTC, announced it publicly (as it should do) and has taken a strong position that this move will not have a detrimental effect to the share price or their corporate social responsibility. If this position was taken by a private business, albeit large, then this would not be such a major pivotal piece of news.”The Bitcoin purchase announcement also had a positive impact on MicroStrategy stock, as it surged by 12%.Back in June 2020, crypto research firm Messari estimated that institutional investors allocating 1% of their capital in Bitcoin could drive the BTC spot price to $50,000. Such a surge will see Bitcoin’s market capitalization reach the $1 trillion mark, similar levels to commodities such as the bullion. A publicly-listed company like MicroStrategy holding Bitcoin as a marketable investment on its corporate balance sheet certainly falls into that same category of institutional investment.The move also signals an emerging sense of Bitcoin as a more mature asset than it was in previous years, according to Anissimov. “The market now has a substantial proportion of professional trading houses and institutional investors, which dampens the volatility and increases the liquidity in the market. Regulation is also more mature in certain jurisdictions,” he said.For Ruben Merre, CEO of crypto hardware wallet NGRAVE, Bitcoin’s improving fundamentals such as the meteoric rise in its hash rate over the years and the spread of trading activity are a testament to its maturity. For Merre, investors see Bitcoin as a way to diversify their investments, as there’s a growing mismatch between the stock market and the economic realities on the ground:“Stimulus spending has a strong effect on stock market prices and even bubble behavior. Meanwhile, economic growth isn’t fully following the pricing, so there is a mismatch. The risk/reward ratio doesn't make much sense, you might argue. It's therefore important for institutional investors to diversify.”More institutional involvement in Bitcoin will likely enhance the maturity of the asset and improve its overall appeal even further. Corporations also wield considerable lobbying power and push favorable regulations that will trigger more growth in the still-nascent crypto scene. But the sheer volume of the buying positions associated with big-money investors can also cause a new wave of FOMO in the retail space. Given that new coin distribution decreased after the May 2020 halving, demand may outstrip Bitcoin supply, which should exert upward pressure on the spot price.Another interesting aspect of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchase is that it constitutes a direct exposure to the asset, as Saylor believes Bitcoin has “more long-term appreciation potential than cash.” Usually, institutional interest in BTC involves indirect investment via shares in hedge funds or derivative contracts, so holding Bitcoin either via self-custody or through third-party custodians has not been popular. However, with improving regulatory clarity, this trend might be due for a change. Back in July, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency granted approval for federally chartered U.S. banks to provide crypto custody service. The news will see national banks in America join the growing trend of large banks extending their custodial services to cryptocurrencies, thereby helping out the big-money investors, who, by law, must store investment assets with approved third-party custodial platforms.Direct exposure to Bitcoin does come with certain risks given the intermittent volatility of the largest crypto by market capitalization. However, the potential upside for investors who hold significant positions does exist amid expectations of the spot price setting a new all-time high. As Kerr opined, many believe Bitcoin to represent “a call option on the current financial system in that it may be a sunk cost and go to zero, but the upside is tremendous if it happens.”Bitcoin is no stranger to a parabolic advance within a bull cycle which usually happens over a few months in contrast to the more measured gains for the likes of gold and silver. For Anissimov, this potential return on investment is providing an enticing incentive for institutional players that are keen on riskier alternatives.So, most seemingly agree that the influx of institutional money into Bitcoin will cause the spot price to climb further. In a note to Cointelegraph, Nisa Amoils, managing partner at crypto hedge fund Grasshopper Capital, summed up the investment thesis of BTC:“People are looking for a way to protect their wealth or that of their shareholders. Bitcoin has always served as a great tool for that purpose. It is sound money built for a digital world. The provable scarcity of Bitcoin will lead to a higher US dollar value as demand for the artificially capped supply sees material increases in demand.”"
1,"Craig Wright, a self-proclaimed Bitcoin (BTC) creator, is apparently not required to pay legal fees for a failed libel suit against the Twitter crypto enthusiast known as Hodlonaut.In an Aug. 14 email to Cointelegraph, Wright’s legal representative argued that he is not obliged to pay legal costs in the defamation suit until the Norwegian Supreme Court considers an appeal.The spokesperson said, “Craig has appealed to the Norwegian Supreme Court. Craig’s Norwegian lawyers say that there is no obligation on Craig to pay the costs until that appeal is dealt with.”The new comments come in response to Hodlonaut claiming that Wright has been ignoring a court filing requiring him to pay legal fees within two weeks following a Jun. 8 court judgment. In an Aug. 13 tweet, Hodlonaut argued that Wright “has not paid a cent” out of $60,000 in two months after the judgement was made.According to Hodlonaut, the Norwegian Court of Appeals denied an appeal to Wright earlier in June. The Twitter persona continued that Wright was obliged to pay “all costs for both District Court and Court of Appeals” in a tweet on June 8.As previously reported, Hodlonaut is one of several crypto people targeted by Wright’s multiple defamation suits aiming to prove that he is the true creator of Bitcoin. Similar cases were brought against Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, and podcaster Peter McCormack.The legal action against Hodlonaut was reportedly triggered by offensive tweets calling Wright a “very sad and pathetic scammer” and claiming that the Australian businessman was “clearly mentally ill.” Hodlonaut is also reportedly involved in the creation of the #CraigWrightIsAFraud hashtag.In response to initial reports on Wright filing a libel suit against Hodlonaut, the crypto community announced a crowdfunding to help the Twitter crypto enthusiast “unfounded legal attacks.” Blockchain entrepreneur Elizabeth Stark was apparently among the first crypto players to support Hodlonaut, announcing WeAreallHodlonaut.com crowdfunding website in April 2019. At the time of writing, the initiative has raised $32,430 worth of Bitcoin (BTC), blowing well past it's initial goal of $20,000.How or whether these funds have been applied to Hodlnaut's legal costs remains uncertain, but the site claims ""We hit our $20k goal but lawyers can get expensive so please keep it up with the donations."" It also features a link for a swag store, the proceeds of which purportedly go to the legal defence fund."
2,"The Winklevoss Twins suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) is a better investment than gold because the metal’s supply will increase after Elon Musk starts mining asteroids.In an interview with internet personality and Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy, the Winklevoss Twins claimed that Bitcoin is a better investment than gold because gold does not have a fixed supply:“There’s billions of dollars of gold floating in asteroids around this planet, and Elon [Musk] is gonna get up there and start mining gold. [...] That’s why gold is a problem, because the supply isn’t fixed like Bitcoin.”Portnoy reasonably asked, ""Is that, like, a real statement?"" to which the founders of Gemini cryptocurrency exchange replied, ""yeah.""To further reiterate the idea that gold is inferior to Bitcoin, one of the twins said that “gold is for boomers” adding that Bitcoin is ""the only fixed asset in the galaxy.”Space mining is not a new idea, in fact Planetary Resources — a firm planning to mine asteroids for profit founded in 2016 — has so far raked in $50.3 million according to company data website Crunchbase. As Cointelegraph reported at the end of 2018, the firm was later acquired by Ethereum-focused blockchain firm Consensys.Some predict that with further development of space travel technology we could soon see a new space race between private companies that are looking to mine minerals in space. CNBC suggested in May 2018 that materials lying in the belt of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter hold “wealth equivalent to about $100 billion for every individual on Earth.”"
3,"Blockchain and data science societies from some of the world’s most prestigious universities have joined blockchain infrastructure providers like Bison Trails as founder members of the Oasis University Program.The program, announced Aug. 13, aims to highlight and popularize the Oasis Network within this student society ecosystem. The Oasis Network is a proof-of-stake blockchain designed to enable the tokenization of data, allowing users to maintain control of what data is shared and to whom.With access to technical support, tutorials and events focused on responsible data, university groups will build apps, run validators and engage in governance on the Oasis Network, as Jernej Kos of the Oasis Foundation explained:“Universities will have the opportunity to foster the growth of a broad and substantive ecosystem focused on building a responsible data economy.”He said that university teams would run local events, take part in tutorials focused on emerging technologies such as secure computing, distributed systems, and machine learning, and engage in the long-term planning of the network.The founder members include blockchain societies from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, along with Berkeley, Cornell and selected universities from around the globe.Meanwhile Professor Dr. Philipp Sandner, head of the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center explained that it was the Oasis Network’s combination of blockchain benefits with data privacy aspects which encouraged his group to “run a node, participate in the network and use it for applied research and practical education.""Bison Trails has been increasingly active in building its profile of late, announcing support for a wealth of platforms over the past few months, and appointing a dedicated general counsel to focus on policy and regulatory issues."
4,"Bitcoin (BTC) may have recovered to $11,700 but miners could soon spark a price plunge, data warns.In an update on Aug. 14, on-chain monitoring resource CryptoQuant identified a spike in mining pool outflows. Aftering remaining stable this month, mining pool outflows have begun to grow, with 802 BTC in aggregated flows recorded by CryptoQuant on Friday.Describing the event as “unusual” in an automated alert, CryptoQuant noted that if the Bitcoin leaving pools were being sent to an exchange, selling pressure could quickly mount, pushing down price.Alternatively, an over-the-counter transaction popular in China, a country home to many major mining pools, would avoid negative price repercussions.In the event, 800 BTC from Poolin — responsible for the lion’s share of newly-mined BTC over the past several days — ended up at Binance. “I expect a little pullback,” CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju commented on Twitter. In comments to Cointelegraph, Ki equated the shipment of BTC to roughly one week’s activity for Poolin.“They mined 147 blocks this week, and the average BTC for block reward is 6.25. So It’s like what they mined per week,” he summarized.Poolin mining pool outflows one-week chart.

The halving itself cut supply dramatically, fueling anticipation of major institutional buy-ins boosting price performance further this month.Bitcoin 7-day average miner revenues six-month chart.

5,"After recovering 6.3% from a drop to $11,200 on Aug. 11, Bitcoin (BTC) price appears to be gearing up for a third run on the $12,000 mark. This comes after a week of bullish news that included Nasdaq-listed investment firm MicroStrategy purchasing 21,454 BTC as protection against the weakening U.S. dollar, Coinbase exchange offering Bitcoin-backed loans, and the revelation that BlackRock and Vanguard are major holders of MicroStrategy shares.Cryptocurrency daily market performance snapshot. Source: Coin360The increasingly bullish sentiment extends across the entire crypto sector, and proof of this comes from altcoins like Tezos (XTZ) and Chainlink (LINK) surging above previous all-time highs, with a handful of DeFi-related tokens following suit. Crypto Fear and Greed Index. Source: Alternative.meThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently shows that sentiment among investors is high, as the indicator reads “Extreme Greed.” This is a sharp contrast from July when the indicator read “Fear” and crypto investors were afraid Bitcoin price would drop back into the low $10,000 range. The daily timeframe shows Bitcoin continuing to make higher lows as the price consolidates into a tighter range between $11,200–$11,800. In a recent newsletter to clients, market intelligence firm Stack Funds said:“A retest of the $12,000 level is in sight as the formation of a bull flag crystallizes. Stack believes that the current market structure will continue to remain intact unless the $10,500 level is breached. Given the current economic backdrop coupled with the weakening dollar, we should continue to see bullish momentum moving forward for Bitcoin.” The firm also pointed to Bitcoin’s growing correlation with gold, noting that BTC price corrected 2.7% as gold retraced by 9% earlier this week. According to the researchers, a unique characteristic of Bitcoin is that the asset is somewhat shielded from wider market volatility as its correlation between gold and equities shifts depending on the price action with each market. Stacks Funds said: “Despite the recent spike in BTC–Gold correlation touching March highs, the record decline in gold this week has not impacted Bitcoin price significantly, as the digital asset catches back on to the equity-like relationship to maintain its upward price trajectory.”Bitcoin daily price chart. Source: Coin360Altcoins also recovered well from the Aug. 11 correction, and Ether (ETH) made waves managing a strong breakout above the $400 resistance level. Ether price rose by 7.88% to a new 2020 high at $430 and XRP price rose by 4.04%. Chainlink (LINK) also reached a new all-time high after rallying 16% to $18.37.  According to CoinMarketCap, the overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $367.4 billion. Bitcoin’s dominance index currently at 59%."
6,"A federal judge has ruled that a New York attorney is responsible for repaying a crypto investment firm after he prematurely released escrow funds set aside for buying $5 million in Bitcoin.According to an Aug. 13 report on Law360, U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan confirmed that attorney Aaron Etra is on the hook for $4.6 million to the San Francisco-based investment firm Benthos Master Fund. The total judgment was for $5.255 million, plus accruing interest.The ruling comes after Etra failed to show for an April court date in New York City confirming an arbitration session and the session itself at the International Chamber of Commerce's International Court of Arbitration at the Hague. The absences were instrumental in the judge ruling in the crypto investment firm’s favor.“He has only himself to blame,” Judge Nathan stated. “Respondent failed to appear or present evidence despite receiving notice of the arbitration and despite the fact that he was clearly required to arbitrate any disputes under the Escrow Agreement.""The agreement in question dates to 2018, when Benthos reached out to Etra to act as an escrow agent for the firm’s Bitcoin (BTC) purchases. The two signed an agreement — appropriately called the Bitcoin Agreement — with Valkyrie Group, an outfit tasked with finding third parties interested in selling their crypto holdings. Initially, Benthos intended to purchase $5 million in BTC — roughly 10,000 coins at the time — and deposited that amount into the escrow fund. Without seeing the approval of Benthos, Etra transferred $4.6 million of the total Bitcoin fund out of escrow over two transactions in August 2018, which never resulted in any crypto assets being sent to the firm.After multiple motions from Benthos essentially asking Etra to stop moving money out of the fund and account for what happened to the $4.6 million, a court ruled the attorney had to produce all documents and information related to the missing funds. Etra did return the remaining $400,000 and produce records of his communications with Bitcoin sellers, so previous motions by Benthos to sanction the attorney and find him in contempt of court were denied. The judgement is for a total of $5.2 million plus interest. This may be a hidden blessing for Etra, who could have potentially been liable for $108 million — which is the current value of the BTC in fiat, if the sale had gone through at the time."
7,"Earlier this week Bitcoin (BTC) bulls and crypto investors were thrilled by the news that MicroStrategy, a Nasdaq-listed business intelligence company worth $1.2 billion, had formally adopted Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset by purchasing 21,454 BTC ($250 million). This led the majority of top crypto analysts and industry folk to post uber-bullish statements on Twitter and for many this confirmed their belief that Bitcoin is in the early stages of a bull market. While this news is exciting and a strong sign that institutional adoption of cryptocurrency continues to occur, there is even better news. BlackRock, the $89 billion investment giant, is the biggest shareholder of MicroStrategy. According to data from CNN Business, BlackRock Fund Advisors hold a 15.24% stake in MicroStrategy. This means MicroStrategy’s recent purchase gives BlackRock indirect exposure to Bitcoin, the company has essentially turned itself into a “publicly-traded Bitcoin play.”MicroStrategy has BlackRock as its biggest stakeholder. Source: CNN BusinessIn an official statement, MicroStrategy said it was adopting Bitcoin as a “primary treasury reserve asset.” and CEO Michael J. Saylor acknowledged  that Bitcoin could potentially be superior to cash. Saylor said:“Since its inception over a decade ago, Bitcoin has emerged as a significant addition to the global financial system, with characteristics that are useful to both individuals and institutions. MicroStrategy has recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made Bitcoin the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy.”The purchase becomes even more interesting when considering the previous comments both Saylor and BlackRock strategists made about Bitcoin.In February 2018 conversation with CNBC, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill said:""We see cryptocurrencies potentially becoming more widely used in the future as the markets mature. Yet for now, we believe they should only be considered by those who can stomach potentially complete losses.”At the time, Turnill laid out some factors that could help buoy Bitcoin in the long-term. He also emphasized that a global regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies could potentially aid the growth of crypto assets.Since then, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) under the G7 established a unified cryptocurrency regulatory framework. Most major countries across Asia, Europe, and the U.S. also adopted clearer policies regarding cryptocurrencies.Saylor, who this week expressed his optimism about the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin had an even more critical perspective in 2013 when he said:“Bitcoin’s days are numbered.  It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.”Companies that previously rejected Bitcoin are now beginning to warm up to cryptocurrencies. For example, JPMorgan reportedly accepted Bitcoin exchanges Coinbase and Gemini as clients in May.Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, said:“Smart publicly listed company buys $250,000,000 worth of bitcoin, as a safe haven asset. Stimulus money flowing from Wall Street into bitcoin. Are you in front or behind them?”This shifting trend in the cryptocurrency industry highlights the increasing maturity of Bitcoin and its growth as a store of value."
8,"Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is following in Grayscale Investments’ footsteps by releasing an ad for cryptocurrency to the general public, this time using print media.A full-page ad for the cryptocurrency investment bank appeared in the U.K.-based international business newspaper Financial Times (FT) today. “Now is the time to invest in Bitcoin,” the ad stated. “In uncertain times, Bitcoin is a hedge independent of the hegemony.""Big ad for bitcoin in the FT today from Galaxy Digital. Love it pic.twitter.com/ro05QdvDFfThe Financial Times had more than one million subscribers as of 2019, with roughly 18% of them millionaires. The news of Galaxy’s ad appearing in print media comes a few days after a new campaign from Grayscale, which released a 30-second spot on business and finance cable TV channels starting on Aug. 10. Richard Heart’s controversial HEX token also has ads plastered across the U.K. on London public transportation, in newspapers, and during soccer games.Many viewers responded negatively to Grayscale’s ad, as there were hopes before it was unveiled that it could ‘bring crypto investing to millions.’ Instead, it simply takes viewers through the history of currency, from seashells to paper.Despite the wide reach of the FT and it’s high net wealth demographic, some Crypto Twitter users were quick to criticise the seemingly outdated choice for a delivery system.“When I think future, I definitely think print media,” said Crypto Twitter user Ryan Leonard.“Little ironic this ad is in the newspaper,” said Brett Dawidowski.But the nature of print allows it to go into detail, labeling Bitcoin (BTC) as “an investable store of value asset that operates independent of the traditional financial system.”“Investors who worry about fiscal profligacy and helicopter money should recognize the value in Bitcoin's inherent scarcity — its hard-coded fixed supply makes it a compelling hedge against inflation,” the ad states.“Bitcoin has outperformed all major asset classes over 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, and it still has room to run.”Twitter user uldtotten described Galaxy’s attempt to educate the public on crypto as “so much cleaner” than Grayscale’s ad.“This paper ad is more powerful than the Grayscale TV ad,” said cryptotothemoon.The FT also released a fairly down beat report on XRP today, stating the token has a “controversial reputation in many parts of the cryptocurrency world” and had yet to achieve widespread adoption among banks."
9,"Barstool Sports founder, Dave Portnoy, posted a video of his meeting with Gemini exchange founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, on Twitter.Portnoy, also known as Davey Day Trader on Twitter for his stock trading antics, recently invited the Winklevoss twins over to his house to teach him about Bitcoin, via an Aug. 4 tweet. After briefing Portnoy on the basics, the twins guided the Twitter trader through a few purchases on Gemini, using the $250,000 he statedly sent to the exchange before their arrival. The trio even discussed Chainlink (LINK) after Portnoy inquired about the asset. Following his fresh crypto asset purchases, the founder asked about creating his own crypto asset, which he referred to as ""Dave Coin."" The twins said they could help on that front.  Portnoy has previously mentioned cryptocurrency several times in the past, often stating his confusion on the subject, as well as his previous holdings, which he reportedly cannot access. Hopefully today's conversation improved the celebrity trader's crypto prowess. "
10,"The U.S. government's attempts to fix the current economic situation could ultimately lead to greater Bitcoin (BTC) adoption, according to Bill Barhydt, CEO of crypto wallet and exchange solution, Abra. ""I think that this is a pivotal moment for Bitcoin as a new asset class,"" Barhydt told Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano during an Aug. 13 podcast interview. Barhydt noted the U.S. government's goals for intentional inflation as rationale for his thesis. As part of the rationale for his claims, Barhdyt mentioned rumors of the U.S. government's upcoming goal of 4% inflation — unheard of territory when it comes to intentional inflation, according to the CEO. ""They feel they have no choice except to basically reflate the economy in order to create growth,"" he added.Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has held seemingly constant talks concerning various corrective measures aimed at reviving the sinking economic ship. One of its latest endeavors includes goals of purposeful heightened inflation, according to an Aug. 4 article from CNBC. ""Their stated aim has never been, and never will be, to protect the value of your money or your wealth,"" Barhydt said of the U.S. government. ""By definition, they are willing to erode the value of your money in order to create movement in the system, which is what creates growth.""Barhydt said the U.S. dollar has lost 99% of its value over the last century, showing governments have no fear when it comes to inflation. An inflation calculator on Saving.org reveals $1 in 1920 held the same purchasing power as $13.60 holds in 2020.  ""We've never had a better time for Bitcoin to stake its claim, not that it needs our help, but for Bitcoin to stake its claim as the defacto hard digital asset that I think it's going to become,"" said the CEO. ""I'm not sure it needed a nudge from our government, but it's getting one nonetheless."" As a deflationary global asset holding a limited supply, Bitcoin lies outside the government, making it a possible hedge on government currencies. Pompliano too has previously spoken on the concept of inflation, noting the importance of exiting cash into other assets, such as BTC. "

12,"Grayscale Investments, the largest digital asset management firm in the world, has been showing exponential increases in investment to its cryptocurrency products. The total sum of assets under management grew by $1 billion in less than two weeks in July, as a Twitter update showed. Additionally, according to the latest documentation, the number of shares Grayscale issued between the first and second quarters of 2020 increased by 90%.Considering that in its Q2 update, the firm revealed it had gathered around $900 million throughout the entire quarter, the interest in Grayscale’s products seems to be growing at an exponential rate. At the time, the firm held over $5.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency collectively, with Bitcoin leading at $4.4 billion. In total, the firm received $1.4 billion in the first half of 2020.The levels of investment in the Grayscale funds are also exceeding those of late 2017, despite the Bitcoin price not being nearly as high. This is generally thought to be one of the best indicators for institutional interest in digital assets, given that no Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund has been approved so far.While Bitcoin is by far the most popular product in the Grayscale family of investment products, other assets have also grown significantly, with Ether (ETH) being the second-biggest gainer. Grayscale has also recently filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, designating it a SEC reporting company if validated. This shows a growing institutional demand for Ether, which is also signaled by growing derivatives volume. This interest is likely powered by the growing activity in the decentralized finance sector and stablecoins.Grayscale investors have also shown interest in diversifying into several cryptocurrencies by investing in the firm’s Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. The fund is the fourth public offering from Grayscale, provides exposure to multiple crypto assets, and is available for over-the-counter share trading. Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of investor relations, told Cointelegraph:“In the first half of 2020, Grayscale saw $1.4B in capital invested into the private placements of its family of products. Demand for alt-coins on the rise Demand for products ex-Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is up 35% Q-over-Q and 81% of returning institutional investors in 2Q20 have now allocated to multiple products (an increase of 71% over T12M).”Shares of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are the fifth and sixth public offerings from Grayscale and have recently received permission from the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to make both funds available for public OTC trading.While Grayscale’s inflows are certainly a sign of institutional interest, also backed by other data sets like CME’s Bitcoin futures Open Interest, some worry these inflows may be exacerbated by accredited investors taking advantage of the premium between the underlying asset and the fund’s share price. Michael Sonnenshein, managing director at Grayscale recently confirmed that accredited investors can still purchase GBTC at the price of Bitcoin:“Those asking... YES, the Grayscale #Bitcoin Trust private placement is available for eligible accredited investors to purchase shares at the Trust’s daily NAV. We accept investments in both cash and $BTC.”According to Grayscale’s latest filing with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission, the number of shares sold increased 90% from the first quarter of the year to the second, which equates to the fund issuing over 87 million shares.   It’s also worth noting that Grayscale shares are traded at a premium that fluctuates, and in July, it reportedly decreased to 10%. According to crypto technology company Amun AG, investors (likely retail) have bought Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares over the last year at a market price 22% above its net asset value on average. Therefore, dips in the premium could have invited arbitrage traders to step in and purchase the shares, suggesting another reason why Grayscale’s products are in high demand.Lanre Jonathan Ige, a researcher at Amun AG, told Cointelegraph that the premiums exist “due to the lack of the ability to create shares on a daily basis (or redeem shares) like in the case of ETPs/ETFs.” He added:“There’s untapped demand for Bitcoin in the US market from those with tax-advantaged accounts like retirement accounts whose only option in BTC (some may not properly even understand the drastic premium for GBTC) so they maintain the demand for GBTC which boosts the premium. Smart investors are able to (of sorts) generate yields equal to the GBTC premium with knowledge the premium is unlikely to fall; or even hedge GBTC exposure by also shorting GBTC when they’ve created new shares.”Nevertheless, the exponential growth for institutional money flowing into Bitcoin and other digital assets can also be observed through other metrics, namely through the derivatives activity in the CME and Bakkt futures markets — both of which have recently posted record numbers both in open interest and volume.Other options for institutional investors are also emerging everywhere. Lanre Jonathan Ige told Cointelegraph that the lack of viable options is one of the reasons for the aforementioned premiums, but new options are starting to appear:“People don’t buy the native asset because many less sophisticated investors aren’t familiar with Coinbase/Kraken and want to invest through brokers they understand and keep the rest of their wealth in. GBTC can be accessed through some brokers that have access to the OTCQX market. Buying Bitcoin through such a wrapper would allow an investor to benefit from many tax advantages in the same way investing in 21Shares’ suite of ETPs likely would.”As Bitcoin continues to establish itself in the public eye as a more reliable asset class, awareness seems to be paying off. Grayscale fosters education for institutions by promoting Bitcoin to financial advisors along with many other strategies. Similarly, Fidelity has also dubbed Bitcoin as an insurance plan for economic turmoil, and Goldman Sachs recently stated that the Bitcoin price may rise alongside gold’s as demand for viable stores of value grows.Not only is Grayscale promoting crypto education to financial advisors, it is also trying to bring crypto awareness to the masses, having recently debuted an advertising campaign on CNBC, MSNBC, FOX and FOX Business in order to “brrring crypto to the masses.” The 30-second video ad, however, received heavy criticism from some in the Bitcoin community for not mentioning Bitcoin and focusing too much on the history of money rather than digital assets. Furthermore, some also criticized the mentioning of controversial forks like Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash and even the quality of the ad itself.In the midst of the ongoing pandemic and a depreciating dollar, it’s only a matter of time until we see a Bitcoin ETF that could be a real game changer for Bitcoin, according to Grayscale’s managing director, Michael Sonnenshein. For now, the closest thing to an ETF is the GBTC fund, which, if it were an ETF, it would be one of the most sought-after in the United States."
13,"Craig Wright, a self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin (BTC), is reportedly ignoring a court ruling that requires him to pay legal fees for a libel suit against Twitter crypto persona Hodlonaut.According to Hodlonaut, a court in Norway ruled that Wright should pay $60,000 in legal costs for the failed libel suit in early June 2020.In an Aug. 13 tweet, Hodlonaut said that the fees should have been paid out by Wright within two weeks after the judgement on June 8. However, the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto “has not paid a cent” in more than two months after the judgement, Hodlonaut claims.Judge ruled that CSW pays my cost of $60,000 within two weeks from the June 8th judgment.

This article will be  updated pending any new information.The libel suit against Hodlonaut is one of a series of similar lawsuits Wright had initiated against major crypto personas like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, and podcaster Peter McCormack. Filed over the course of 2019, the suits sought to deny claims that Wright was lying about being the true creator of Bitcoin. None of these suits have turned out to be successful and Wright has abandoned several. Alongside multiple libel suits, Wright is the center of the long-running legal battle initiated by the estate of his former partner, Dave Kleiman. In this case, Wright has to prove his access to 1.1 million bitcoins that he allegedly mined together with Kleiman in early days of Bitcoin.Yesterday, Calvin Ayre, one of the most high-profile supporters of the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, announced that he is funding a new documentary and book about the life of Wright."
14,"Bitcoin (BTC) is repeating the bull run that sent it to $20,000, chart data shows as a new report says $10,000 was an “entry point” for investors.In a tweet on Aug. 13, Cointelegraph analyst filbfilb highlighted clear similarities between the past few weeks for Bitcoin and its run to all-time highs in 2017.The key metric, filbfilb said, is the interplay between BTC/USD spot price and its 20-week moving average.At present, the relationship between the two is copying that from late 2016, laying the foundations for the bull run which delivered returns of over 3,000% within the year.In comments, filbfilb added that 2020 was giving signs of being different to bullish phases that had come since, specifically the three-month run last year which topped out at $13,800.Focusing on the near-term, however, fellow Cointelegraph analyst Michaël van de Poppe argued that a failure to retain $11,200 would result in a correction towards $10,000.“$11,200 is the support area. If that’s lost, we’ll see more ranging and look for $10,500-10,700 first,” he commented on Thursday.Filbfilb had previously told Telegram trading channel subscribers that reaching $11,600 would fuel a return to $12,000, but that this level would “unlikely” be cleared.BTC/USD weekly chart with 20-week moving average highlighted. Source: filbfilb/ TwitterZooming out, other sources were likewise bullish. In a report released today, the research arm of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, OKEx Insights and blockchain analytics company Catallact, said its technical investigations revealed definitive support for Bitcoin at $10,000.“In light of these insights, it would appear that the March 2020 crash saw weak hands pushed out of the market, allowing it to gradually recover and reclaim $10,000 — which put most open positions today in the green,” researchers concluded. “Moreover, the position buildup leading up to current levels (between $10K and $12K), coupled with the current mildness of profit-taking, indicates that these prices were deemed reasonable entry points by participants. It also indicates that those in profit are willing to hold their coins for larger gains in the future.”OKEx added that the possibility of BTC/USD returning below $10,000 may now be over.As Cointelegraph reported, a consensus is already building around institutions digging in at current price levels, fuelled by buys from Grayscale and MicroStrategy which vastly outpaced newly mined BTC."
15,"The more time you spend in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, the more you encounter some fairly arcane technologies and their accompanying terminologies. Blockchain technology, which started out as a simple immutable record composed of blocks of data, is constantly evolving. Although the broader tech world operates similarly, the blockchain and crypto sector moves at a much more rapid pace.We are all racing to create the fastest, most efficient protocol or scalable and resilient app, and must build and improvise along the way. In such a competitive atmosphere, these races force innovation. When scalability is limited, alternative technologies must be developed. With things moving so quickly in this space, it’s easy to get lost in a sea of acronyms and abbreviations. As a result, I thought it might be helpful to offer an explainer regarding DLTs, DAGs and more.Firstly, let’s distinguish between “blockchain” and “distributed ledger technology.” A common misconception is that blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology are the same. For the purposes of this article, we’ll keep it simple and establish that blockchain and distributed ledger technology, or DLT, are not interchangeable terms. Distributed ledger technology is defined as a digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple places at the same time. Blockchain stands for a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust.Both blockchains and DLTs share similar characteristics and refer to a record of information that’s distributed across a network, but each come with their own defining features:“Put simply, the public aspect of blockchains generally implies three interrelated things: 1) Anyone can use the blockchain, 2) anyone can serve as a validating node of the blockchain, and 3) anyone who becomes a node can, in turn, act as part of that blockchain's governance mechanism. In theory, this makes blockchains decentralized and democratic structures resistant to undue control or influence from any single party.By contrast, a distributed ledger generally doesn't enable any or most of these public features.”Let’s talk about directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs. A DAG protocol is an alternative to the traditional blockchain and can be categorized as a distributed ledger technology. A number of protocols like Conflux, Hedera Hashgraph, IOTA and Nano, along with smaller startup projects like IoT Chain and Obyte use DAG-based structures. Many see DAG technology as the next evolution of blockchain as it can help resolve speed and scalability issues and offer lower transaction costs.DAG-based protocols mainly differ in how transactions are added to a network. Unlike blockchain technology, individual DAG transactions are linked to one another directly rather than joined together in blocks and processed. Since this structure can reference many “blocks” at one time, the transactions per second, or TPS, rate is much higher than that of a standard blockchain. Bitcoin’s TPS varies somewhere between four to seven, Ethereum sits at 30, and centralized legacy services like Visa support throughput rates of about 1,000 TPS. Today, some DAG-based protocols can handle a TPS rate into the several thousands.DAG-based structures also provide a more energy-efficient block sequencing algorithm for proof-of-work that eliminates the discarding of forked blocks — a key differentiator from traditional blockchain technology. When no blocks are discarded, it means there is no wasted computing power, resulting in lower transaction costs. All of this can be achieved using a DAG-based structure without changing core storage or consensus mechanisms and compromising security.Every network has its own valid reasons to run a particular consensus mechanism. Some networks use proof-of-stake or new transactions to validate previous ones without the use of miners. PoS consumes significantly less energy than PoW, but still has many unknowns surrounding security and game theoretics that will take time to fully uncover and address.DAG protocols are built as novel structures that could potentially support immensely scalable ecosystems. IOTA runs the Tangle, Hedera’s is called Hashgraph, Conflux has its Tree Graph, and so on. There are slight differences between each project’s protocol and design choices.A similarity between Conflux’s Tree Graph and IOTA’s Tangle is the use of two previous blocks or transactions on the graph as the parents of a new one. However, the Tree Graph is run in a decentralized manner on each node, while Tangle currently uses a centralized “coordinator” to provide finality for transactions. Hedera’s Hashgraph orders blocks based on the median propagation time of a gossip network. A difference between all three is that Hedera and IOTA use PoS or something similar in block generation, while Conflux uses PoW.Clearly, there is no standard approach or official guideline when it comes to blockchain development. It’s up to each team behind a protocol to determine what particular consensus mechanism should be used for the specific application.As blockchain and cryptocurrency developers work toward creating technologies that address the existing speed, scalability and cost issues, DAGs present an encouraging approach. When you look toward the future, it’s important to keep this in mind: At the moment, Bitcoin (BTC) processes about five transactions per second. DAG-based systems can process tens of thousands of transactions per second. As we continue moving toward mass adoption, directed acyclic graphs certainly show some promise in addressing the nagging issue of scalability.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Eden Dhaliwal, the global managing director at Conflux Network, is spearheading Conflux Network’s global expansion.

16,"Institutions are buying huge amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and hodling, not selling it, data shows as the network mimics early 2016.Data from various sources uploaded to social media this week show that over 40% of the Bitcoin supply has now not left its wallet in two years.At the same time, institutional-grade sources are purchasing huge amounts of BTC, in what looks increasingly like preparations for a long-term investment strategy.“In the last two weeks... - Grayscale added 14,422 BTC to $GBTC. - Microstrategy bought 21,454 BTC. - Bitcoin miners mined 12,594 BTC,” analyst Kevin Rooke summarized.Institutions’ current and prospective love of Bitcoin hit the headlines this week thanks to MicroStrategy, which made the largest cryptocurrency its new treasury reserve asset. The 21,454 BTC buy-in came at a cost of $250 million. Grayscale, meanwhile, has returned to Bitcoin purchases after a temporary moratorium. The company already owns a huge number of coins with Cointelegraph reporting that it is on track to hold 3.4% of the total supply by 2021 as its AUM recently surpassed $5 billion.Throughout the past weeks, miners have contributed fewer coins in supply compared even to demand from these two institutional players. Since the release of “new” BTC per block is fixed — and went down 50% at the halving in May — price rises were all but guaranteed.Fixed supply, changing of which requires miner consensus, which would likely make all network participants poorer, is a key feature of Bitcoin which has allowed it to preserve its status as digitally scarce hard money.Bitcoin buying from Grayscale and MicroStrategy Vs. supply.

Instead, a long-term investment strategy seems to already be in play, with almost half the available supply staying stationary for at least two years.“The last time this much supply had built up and was locked in Bitcoin was January 2016,” Charles Edwards of digital asset manager Capriole commented, adding:“Despite the recent price rises, no one wants to take profits. Demand is increasing and supply is reducing.”Bitcoin hodl wave chart showing stationary supply.

17,"Major United States-based crypto exchange Kraken has released a report predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) will rally by between 50% and 200% in the coming months.The report notes that Bitcoin posted a 21-month low for volatility on July 24 of just 23%, and stated that BTC’s 12 historic volatility lows (of between 15% and 30%) have typically been followed by a rally of 140% on average.With August usually the third-most volatile month for BTC price fluctuations, Kraken is predicting that upward momentum produced by Bitcoin at the end of July will continue for several months to come.Kraken emphasized that Bitcoin’s recent rally resulted in the second-strongest July for BTC price performance since 2011, noting that July was usually the third-weakest calendar month for Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s 14.5% jump between July 27 to July 31 drove the month’s overall performance to a 24% gain, positioning the market for continued momentum, according to Kraken.Prior to the move, July produced what the report describes as a “suppressed pocket” of weak volatility. Ten of the 12 past instances of Bitcoin entering a suppressed pocket have been followed by gains exceeding 196%.Kraken estimates that 44% of July’s total trade volume transpired during the final seven days of the month.The report also notes that Bitcoin’s rolling 30-day correlation with gold jumped to a one-year high of 0.93 on July 31.The spike comes after the monthly correlation fell to a 10-month low of -0.66 on July 2, contradicting predictions that gold and Bitcoin would emerge as popular “safe-haven” assets and move in-step throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and recession."
18,"Combined global peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin trading volumes have surged to their highest levels since January 2018, with nearly $95 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) changing hands on Localbitcoins and Paxful in the first week of August.The spike comes as many Latin American markets have seen trade activity rally into new highs over recent weeks, with the Bitcoin P2P markets in Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Bolivia, Honduras, Paraguay, Uruguay and The Bahamas all posting record highs since the start of July.Venezuelan trade still represents the lion’s share of Latin America’s nearly $13 billion in weekly P2P trade, posting more than $5 million in volume for two consecutive weeks. Colombia is the second-strongest Latin market with more than $3 million, followed by Argentina and Peru with roughly $1 million a week each.An extra $1 million in weekly trade would see Latin America post new all-time highs for regional P2P trade.African peer-to-peer trade has also continued to rally, with the Sub-Saharan region posting new volume records for seven of the past 10 weeks.While Nigeria still represents 50% of the region’s roughly $18 million weekly volume, the markets of South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Botswana, Zambia, and Sudan have posted new records over the past fortnight.Kenya is Africa’s second-strongest market with $3.6 million in weekly trade, followed by South Africa and Ghana with roughly $2 million each.

When shorts are liquidated, short holders are forced to market buy, causing buying demand.A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” cited data from Hyblockcapital to suggest that there is high liquidity in the $11,500 to $12,000 range. Many traders seemingly shorted Bitcoin on the way down, causing short liquidation prices to be present at around $12,000. The trader said said:“Green day today. Who could have possibly thought?

The Bitcoin Hash Ribbon indicator lit up for the first time since it signaled a rally when BTC was hovering at $9,500.Market data provider Glassnode said:“The Bitcoin Hash Ribbon indicator can be used to identify market bottoms due to miner capitulation. It last indicated a buy signal when BTC was around $9,500, which is up over 20% since then.”In recent weeks, the cryptocurrency market has seen a significant increase in appetite for small and medium market cap assets. Led by the DeFi craze, altcoins have massively outperformed Bitcoin since the start of August.TradeBlock head of research John Todaro said:“This crypto market reminds me of early-mid 2017 when most mainstream media outlets ignored the space at large, while mid cap alts were doing 10-15x.”In the medium to long-term, the strong performances from altcoins could catalyze a strong Bitcoin rally. Previous price cycles show that a substantial altcoin market rally is typically followed by a profit-taking rally where the proceeds flow into Bitcoin and Ether (ETH)."

Here’s a preview of one of this month’s editions. Crypto asset prices have flown upward in recent weeks, with various altcoins posting gains reminiscent of the great 2017 digital asset bubble. Assets such as Chainlink (LINK) and Band Protocol (BAND) have tallied triple digits percentage gains. Bitcoin (BTC), the industry’s pioneer asset, has also shown significant upside action. The asset travelled up slightly past $12,000 on Aug. 2 before subsequently falling more than $1,000 in the same 24-hour period. Aug. 10 saw BTC return to the $12,000 level, again facing rejection, sustaining a subsequent drop of several hundred dollars. Overall sentiment in the crypto investing and trading realm, however, remains high. Mainstream financial players also continue entering the digital asset industry via Bitcoin, with intelligence giant MicroStrategy as one of the latest entrants.

Over the last two weeks, the market has expressed a significant bullish tone, topping at 1.2 standard deviations during Bitcoin’s most recent run toward $12,000. Data also shows an uptick in the number of dollars moving onto centralized exchanges via U.S. dollar stablecoin USDC — a signal which has often proved as a precursor to previous bullish Bitcoin price action. In contrast, Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value, or MVRV, ratio looks troublesome, posting a 30-day value of 1.15 on August 2. This essentially means short-term Bitcoin investors boasted an average 15% profit across the board. On a separate front, Ethereum holds hot on Bitcoin’s tail in terms of transaction volume. Bitcoin now touts 3.4x the transaction volume seen on Ethereum’s blockchain, a dwindling lead, according to numbers from the beginning of August.

23,"The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, an investment tool that aims to provide an indirect exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) for investors in traditional markets, reported a significant increase in how many shares it issued between Q2 and Q1 of 2020.According to an Aug. 7 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the trust issued more than 87 million shares in Q2 2020, compared to the total of 133 million shares issued for all of 2020.The trust issued almost 90% more shares in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first. This also represents more than a six-fold increase compared to the first half of 2019, when only 23 million shares were issued. Net assets increased by $1.6 billion in Q2 2020 to a $3.5 billion total. About half of this growth came from the appreciation of Bitcoin held by the trust, amounting to 386,720 BTC as of June 30. At current market prices, it would be worth $4.4 billion.Grayscale is often criticized for the impossibility in redeeming the trust’s shares. Some institutions and accredited investors are able to purchase shares at their true value as determined by how much Bitcoin the trust is holding. However, doing so requires a minimum six months waiting period as the shares in the trust are locked up.The GBTC trust has consistently traded at a significant premium over its net asset value, meaning that investors are overpaying to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin. In addition to the lock up period that limits potential arbitrage plays, some noted that there is no mechanism to balance the trust’s share prices should they trade at a discount.  According to yCharts, the premium generally stays around 20%. However, it saw considerable dips to 10% in April and July of 2020, potentially signaling the presence of arbitrage traders. However, given that the premium returned to mean values, it is unlikely that arbitrage accounts for the entirety of the trust’s growth.Some of these issues may explain community excitement for a Bitcoin ETF. In addition to potentially trading on well-known exchanges, exchange-traded funds also see a daily arbitrage of their share price compared to the value of its assets, ensuring that their prices track their underlying assets.Cointelegraph previously reported that Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust trades at even higher premiums."
24,"MicroStrategy has adopted Bitcoin (BTC) as its reserve currency — and stunned commentators by purchasing over 21,000 BTC on Aug. 11.The world’s largest publicly-traded business intelligence company has swapped fiat for Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset, but the reasons behind it suggest that more big businesses will have no choice but to do the same.Why did MicroStrategy choose Bitcoin, and will others follow?In a press release issued on Aug. 11, CEO Michael Saylor went further than most by calling Bitcoin “digital gold.”With no “ifs” or “buts,” Saylor unreservedly plugged the largest cryptocurrency over both fiat and other traditional safe-haven assets such as gold.“Bitcoin is digital gold – harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it,” he commented. That angle closely mimics some of Bitcoin’s foremost proponents, notably Saifedean Ammous, who in his book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” repeatedly explains that so-called “digital scarcity” puts Bitcoin in a separate league to any other form of money which has ever existed.Like Ammous, Saylor also believes that Bitcoin’s very structure will ensure that its value will only increase with time.He added: “We expect its value to accrete with advances in technology, expanding adoption, and the network effect that has fueled the rise of so many category killers in the modern era.”Bitcoiners were particularly excited about MicroStrategy because it unashamedly replaced fiat currency for cryptocurrency.Its purchase of 21,454 BTC for an aggregate price of $250 million late last month may not only be symbolic (given the total 21M BTC) but it also means that the company controls 0.1% of the total Bitcoin supply — something competitors will find increasingly expensive to replicate.“MicroStrategy bought 0.1% of the Bitcoin supply. Very few companies will be able to copy this strategy,” What Bitcoin Did podcast host Peter McCormack tweeted in response.For Saylor, there were multiple red flags that swayed him to turn to Bitcoin.These were “among other things, the economic and public health crisis precipitated by COVID-19, unprecedented government financial stimulus measures including quantitative easing adopted around the world, and global political and economic uncertainty,” he said.Continuing, he argued that what began as a result of Covid-19 would only cause further problems later on:“We believe that, together, these and other factors may well have a significant depreciating effect on the long-term real value of fiat currencies and many other conventional asset types, including many of the assets traditionally held as part of corporate treasury operations.”Cointelegraph has often reported on the detrimental impact of practices such as quantitative easing, and the voices urging consumers to abandon the fiat system en masse to protect their prosperity in the long term.For Jason Yanowitz, founder of financial media network BlockWorks Group, Saylor’s reservations will ultimately spark trailblazing from the entire business sphere.“MicroStrategy’s CEO said they bought Bitcoin to avoid inflation,” he summarized. “Eventually every public company will do the same.”This week, Cointelegraph noted that Bitcoin’s value appeared to be tracking central banks’ inflating balance sheets in 2020.Finally, Saylor was highly complimentary about Bitcoin in particular — and did not mention that the company even considered any other cryptocurrencies.“We find the global acceptance, brand recognition, ecosystem vitality, network dominance, architectural resilience, technical utility, and community ethos of Bitcoin to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as an asset class for those seeking a long-term store of value,” he said.Bitcoin’s eleven-year lifespan has seen it both remain the largest cryptocurrency and fend off multiple concerted efforts to undermine it.As Ammous and various others often explain, Bitcoin has proven itself via this method — and alternative cryptocurrencies have failed to demonstrate that they can gain Bitcoin’s status and popularity.Miners’ preference for BTC supports the theory that in the long term, security and market prowess will only increase — Bitcoin’s technical fundamentals remain in a broad uptrend, a result of miners dedicating more and more resources to the network."
25,"Bitcoin acts more like a tech startup stock than digital gold — with investors reaping big rewards if it works but potentially losing everything if the crypto asset fails.That’s the conclusion of an Aug. 10 report from digital asset manager CoinShares titled A Little Bitcoin Goes a Long Way. In it authors James Butterfill and Christopher Bendiksen argue that the fact Bitcoin (BTC) “starting its life at a price of zero” gave it a stellar reputation.“If it reaches its potential, the value could be immense,” the report stated.“At the same time, there is a non-zero chance that it fails entirely, leaving the value of Bitcoin close to zero.”Unlike many experts who suggest setting aside 1% of a portfolio for cryptocurrencies, CoinShares suggested investors allocate “just under 4%” for Bitcoin alone.The firm tested Bitcoin as a reliable store of value by seeing how the cryptocurrency performed as part of a balanced 60/40 portfolio. It’s analysis indicated that the token enhanced annualized returns by 9.7% starting from 2015, almost double comparable assets.Behaving like a tech stock is no bad thing. Since the crypto bloodbath in March, tech stocks have gained enormous ground. The price of Amazon rose 70.7% to $3,170, Apple rose 63.3% to $450, Facebook 54.5% to $263, and Google 23.6% to $1,496.The report comes after a period of volatility with Bitcoin testing the $12,000 threshold for the first time since 2019. “Bitcoin is an asset in its infancy,” the Coinshares report states. “As Bitcoin matures, its robustness is further proven, and its risk of failure moves further and further away from zero, we believe investors will start treating it differently, leading its macroeconomic behaviour to follow suit.”"
26,"With sentiment suggesting Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto markets are about to go on a bull run, seasoned old timers are warning about the lessons learned from previous rallies. With Bitcoin correcting 5% in the past day, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is back to 75. A measure of sentiment that looks at the volatility, market volume and social media activity of digital currencies, a reading of 75 equates to “greed,” down slightly from 84 — or “extreme greed” — that was recorded on Aug. 10. But both readings suggest expectations are sky high of boom times ahead.In a Twitter thread on Aug. 11, MyCrypto and MyEtherWallet co-founder Taylor Monahan laid out some good old fashioned advice learned during the 2017 bull run. She pointed out the irrational exuberance of bull markets invariably attracts bad actors preying on the vulnerable. “They will make a lot of money and people will lose because the exuberance and FOMO and greed and hype are the most powerful things on earth,” she wrote. Monahan believes the time for accumulation has now passed, and pushed for users to put 90% to 95% of their crypto assets into cold storage. She suggests that you don’t go chasing shiny new coins: “Pick a few long-term legit coins that you like. Be invested in them. Do research. Do not follow the shills [...] You will win if you take profits consistently, not if you try to call top.”Monahan also stressed restraint and pointed out that people who “take on huge debt to get crypto” will not win, but will “lose their house, their kids’ savings. Do not be those losers.”Like many experts, Monahan believes investors should risk just 5% of their net worth, and once it’s been lost, they shouldn’t try to recoup those losses.“Have fun with it but once it’s gone, it’s gone. Don’t double down. Don’t take from your savings account or your cold storage.” Crypto researcher Chris Burniske said in an Aug. 7 tweet it was “hard to be adequately prepared” for a bull run. He expects that enthusiasm from “crypto diehards” will be 10 times what it was in 2017, implying there may be reckless buying and selling of assets in the face of wild predictions.“Speculation cycles have accompanied promising new technologies for hundreds of years,” said Burniske.“While no one can quite control them, we can control how we react, present, educate, communicate and steward the space.”Fans of podcaster Anthony Pompliano will be familiar with his frequently reposted advice for what to do in a bull run. Some users believe the advice is a jinx, as every time he posts it, the market appears to turn bearish.Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:

- BTC is very volatile
- You can lose all of your money
- Only invest what is ok to lose
- Twitter is not investment advice
- Don't buy BTC with credit cards
- Keep low time preference
- Do your own research

🙏🏽🙏🏽Market manipulation is harder than it used to be, but certainly still happens in 2020. Cointelegraph reported in June that crypto whales have the ability to alter the price of certain digital assets using a variety of techniques.And remember, sometimes those whales can be influencers paid with millions of tokens to shill coins. Even those who aren’t paid to promote a project are biased in favour of their own investments. Monahan’s advice: “Trust no one.”“Even good people are motivated by the coins they hold and the relationships they have. You may eventually see the edge but you will never know fullness. Make decisions based on multiple sources and your knowledge and your gut.”"
27,"Today the open interest on Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin (BTC) futures reached a new all-time high at $841 million. Although this can't be deemed bullish on a standalone basis, it does signal that professional investors' interest in Bitcoin continues to grow at an immense rate. Further proof of this comes as MicroStrategy, a Nasdaq-listed company worth more than $1.2 billion, announced the acquisition of 21,000 Bitcoin for $250M. This shows that regardless of what critics have said about cryptocurrencies, savvy investors and entrepreneurs have recently built sizable positions in Bitcoin and some altcoins.CME Bitcoin futures open interest in USD terms. Source: SkewThe best way to gauge inventors sentiment on futures contracts is by measuring their premium versus Bitcoin’s market price at spot exchanges. Typically, the indicator should display a 0.5% to 1% premium for 1-month contracts in CME futures. By postponing the financial settlement date, it is only natural that sellers are required to put up more money. On the other hand, an excessive premium will create an arbitrage opportunity, as one can sell the futures contract while simultaneously buying the same amount on spot markets. This is a neutral market strategy, commonly known as 'cash and carry.'CME Bitcoin futures basis, or premium. Source: TradingViewThe above chart shows how the basis has consistently held a favorable terrain since mid-March, recently sustaining levels above the 1% premium for ten consecutive days. A positive basis indicates contango, meaning sellers are demanding more money to postpone settlement. This situation, known as contango, is the primary indicator of a healthy and bullish derivatives market. This is especially true when open interest increases, as new positions are being created under these ideal circumstances. CME Bitcoin options markets are relatively new, having just launched in January 2020. It certainly looks modest compared to the leading exchange Deribit, although CME has reached an impressive $440 million open interest in late-June.Bitcoin options open interest. Source: SkewThe current $171 million CME options open interest carries a trend that has been consistent since its launch, as they are heavily concentrated on call options.This means investors are able to capitalize on the right to acquire CME Bitcoin futures at a fixed price, also known as a strike.CME options contracts expire on the last Friday of every month, causing the sharp drops in open interest seen on the chart chart. As things currently stand, 66% of CME open interest sits on the August 28 expiry, while another 14% is set to mature in late September.Call options are usually related to bullish strategies. However, they are also used for 'covered calls', which are rather neutral and aim to generate a fixed income as long as the underlying asset remains above a certain threshold.The best way one can spot call options being used for market-neutral strategies is by monitoring to see if the percentage of open interest is well below current market levels. Spotting this difference is crucial to correctly gauge if call options are being used mostly for bullish or neutral positions.CME Bitcoin options open interest by strikes. Source: CMEEach CME option contract represents 5 BTC and the most relevant strikes for August and September expiries are expressed in the chart above. The first thing to note is the absence of volumes below the $10,000 level. Of the current $171 million in CME options open interest, 80% are call options, which is another bullish indicator. Considering the most significant strike levels of August and September contracts, one can infer those options are mostly being used on bullish strategies.To ascertain whether this positive stance holds on the broader options markets, one should review the total open interest by strike by aggregating every derivatives exchange. Regardless of whether these are more concentrated on call or put options, a substantial open interest on strikes below market levels is either neutral or bearish.Aggregate Bitcoin options open interest, in BTC thousands. Source: SkewThere are currently 44,700 BTC open interest below $10,000, totaling $514 million. This figure represents only 28% of the current $1.84 billion aggregate open interest and signals bullishness from options markets and corroborates the CME call options analysis.By monitoring derivatives markets, one can gauge professional traders sentiment and better evaluate today's failure to break $12,000 resistance and its subsequent test of $11,150 level.Both futures and options indicators are signaling bullishness, and thereby should have more importance than charts and trading data from August 2019 markets. Back then, Bitcoin (BTC) tested $12,000 for a week before declining 20% over the next five days. Bitcoin (USD) in August 2019. Source: TradingViewWill the pattern repeat this time? That is a good question, and a valid fear for veteran Bitcoin investors familiar with just how volatile the digital asset is.

28,"China accounts for more than half of the world’s Bitcoin mining capacity but Jameson Lopp, the co-founder and CTO of Casa, has hosed down fears that Chinese miners are a threat to Bitcoin in a blog post on Aug. 9.Although many people have raised concerns over the concentration of such much hashpower being located in China, Loop pointed out that even in the event of a 51% attack on Bitcoin, attackers are limited in what they can actually do. He explained that attackers can't steal people's Bitcoin arbitrarily, nor change the consensus rules. They can’t reverse valid transactions. The only thing they can do is double spend their own Bitcoin. The best way for a 51% attacker to seek maximum profit is to cash out via crypto exchanges into “censorship resistant cryptocurrency or stablecoin”. However, this presents big problems in terms of withdrawal limits and Know Your Customer requirements among exchanges. It also doesn’t make much economical sense for attackers to dump a big chunk of Bitcoin at once: “The value of the Bitcoin you still hold after the attack will likely have decreased substantially, thus a successful large attack could actually result in shooting yourself in the foot. You'd better not slip up while you're accessing the exchange you target. For example, one hacker returned $25M in stolen funds after leaking their IP address.”Loop thinks it would be nearly impossible for a nation state to get in total control of mining facilities and that Bitcoin stakeholders would take immediate emergency actions against such an act. Even if the attack shifts from targeting individual mining facilities to an easier attack of mining — 70% of hashpower in China is coordinated via fewer than 10 mining pools — switching mining pools is incredibly easy for miners. It’s also difficult to pull off covertly as there are plenty of independent companies putting out social media alerts against malicious actors.“It's hard to imagine a scenario in which a state actor would be able to quickly and covertly seize enough hashpower to perform an ongoing attack that lasts more than a few hours.” According to Lopp, the reason hashpower has been concentrated in China ever since 2015 is due to the fact most of the mining chips are produced in Asia. Most importantly China also has “an abundance of cheap energy” and has the political and economical stability to facilitate the mining infrastructures. Loop concluded any large-scale mining attack is going to be “limited in its effectiveness”. As Cointelegraph reported before, in the long run, competition in semiconductor production and cheaper power sources will continue to rise globally and China’s mining dominance will not last."
29,"According to recently published research, an attacker has found vulnerabilities in the Tor browser network that might have allowed them to steal Bitcoin (BTC) from users. Tor was developed by the U.S. government for anonymous internet communication and has since been adopted by privacy advocates. Because of its privacy-preserving features, it is also popular with the denizens of the Dark Web. Many in the crypto community rely on Tor, entrusting their Bitcoin transactions to its security and anonymity.Confirmed malicious Tor exit capacity controlled by a malicious player. Source: nusenu.However, according to nusenu, who discovered this attack, this might not be a good choice. Tor protects user anonymity by routing data through a number of relays. Tor exit relays are the last hop in this process, and the only ones that get to see the actual destination of the Tor user. Starting in January, a malicious party allegedly began running a large number of Tor exit relays, peaking at 23% of the total in May.The malicious Tor exit relays were performing what is known as a “person-in-the-middle” attack:“They perform person-in-the-middle attacks on Tor users by manipulating traffic as it flows through their exit relays. They (selectively) remove HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects to gain full access to plain unencrypted HTTP traffic without causing TLS certificate warnings.”This is a known vulnerability and there are countermeasures that are available, but unfortunately, many website operators do not implement them. According to nusenu, the attackers were primarily focused on cryptocurrency related sites. They would replace user’s Bitcoin address with their own, thus, routing coin to their wallets:“It appears that they are primarily after cryptocurrency related websites — namely multiple bitcoin mixer services. They replaced bitcoin addresses in HTTP traffic to redirect transactions to their wallets instead of the user provided bitcoin address.”The number of relays controlled by the hacker has gone down to about 10% as of August. While the researcher has informed some affected Bitcoin services of the vulnerability, we do not know how much Bitcoin has already been stolen by the hackers."
30,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) rejected the $12,000 resistance level for the second time in the past 10 days. Traders are generally optimistic about the short-term trend of BTC, following its extended consolidation below a critical resistance level.When an asset stays relatively stable near a major resistance area, it typically suggests a bullish continuation is likely. It shows that sellers do not have enough pressure to push BTC down to a pivotal price point. Many traders seemingly anticipate the price of Bitcoin to remain in the $10,500–$12,000 range. If BTC does not drop below a key support level at $10,500, technical analysts say that the bullish market structure will remain intact.The confluence of a positive global macro backdrop and a robust market structure are just some of the encouraging sentiments around Bitcoin, but investors have also expressed concerns about some short-term roadblocks facing it.The primary factor behind predictions for a bullish continuation of Bitcoin in the near term is its long-term market structure. Analysts say that the high time frame charts of BTC, like the monthly chart, indicate a clear breakout, with BTC escaping a prolonged price range that often leads to an extended rally, especially if the breakout occurs on a high time frame chart. Raoul Pal, CEO of Global Macro Investor, stated:“Super early days for what is likely to be a very big move as institution finally follow what retail BTC investors have known all along — that this is the future and its wildly under priced.”Since its peak in 2017, when it almost achieved the $20,000 mark, BTC has ranged within a multiyear price range, bottoming out at $3,150 in 2018 while seeing a local high of $14,000 in July 2019 and establishing a three-year range. But when the price of Bitcoin recently surpassed $11,500, it confirmed on the weekly and monthly charts that the dreaded range has been broken. Various market data could also supplement the uptrend of Bitcoin over the longer term.Kyle Davis, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, hinted that there is a small gap between $14,000 and $20,000 in the options market. Citing data from options exchange Deribit, Davis said, “$BTC air above $14k up to $20k,” which suggests that a breakout above $14,000 could fuel the next BTC rally.Some Bitcoin traders also emphasized that the current market structure of Bitcoin is highly optimistic. Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, said that the absorption of Bitcoin’s dips shows that the trend of BTC is bullish: “It’s dip buying season and that any chance to grab a higher low is welcome. This is a bullish chart, period.”In the four-hour price chart of Bitcoin published by Melker, Bitcoin recorded four higher lows, or four local low points that are higher than previous lows. A higher low pattern in technical analysis is considered a positive formation because it demonstrates strength from buyers. Every dip in the past 10 days was bought by Bitcoin buyers.The positive technical factors surrounding Bitcoin have been complemented by encouraging on-chain data points. According to on-chain market data provider IntoTheBlock, the number of Bitcoin “HODLers” has substantially increased:“The HODLING trend for #Bitcoin continues. As can be seen in the graph below the number of $BTC hodlers has increased by almost 4 million within the last twelve months. As of August 9, a total of 20.47 million addresses were holding 11.51m BTC for over a year.”In the short term, Bitcoin faces two obstacles: first, a historically relevant fractal, and second, a slight drop in liquidity. Both factors could impose selling pressure on Bitcoin in the near term, but compared to a few weeks ago, the overall sentiment around BTC remains positive.Nik Yaremchuk, a cryptocurrency trader, said that historical fractals hint at a short-term pullback. He compared the current price action of Bitcoin to that seen in May. Three months ago, BTC also saw a similar trend where the price looked to break out and then recorded a correction: “We now have a fractal since May 2020, where we have been in range for a while, I do not think that we are here for long, but it seems to me that we will get another dip.”The fractal coincides with a slight decline in the liquidity of Bitcoin. Market research firm Glassnode said that while the overall transaction rates of BTC are healthy, they declined slightly in the past week:“Liquidity also saw a slight decrease, losing 3 points due to a drop in the transaction liquidity subcategory. This, in turn, was caused by the above-mentioned decrease in the number of on-chain transactions over the past week. However, overall transaction rates remain high relative to pre-bull market levels.”Still, speaking to Cointelegraph, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at exchange and brokerage platform BeQuant, said that Bitcoin being rejected at $12,000 is not necessarily bad. The pattern of an upsurge followed by consolidation stabilizes the market and provides investors some breathing room:“Price discovery and consolidation following a strong run up is an indication of a healthy two way market flow. Price rejection is not necessarily a bad development, as it gives market participants an opportunity to take stock of the situation and look to align the interest of both leveraged/speculative flow and those of long-term holders.”In the upcoming weeks, there are several variables that could affect Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. The most prominent factor that might impact Bitcoin is likely the upward run of altcoins.In recent weeks, altcoins, especially in decentralized finance, have gained substantially against major cryptocurrencies. Band Protocol’s native BAND token and Chainlink’s LINK, for example, rose by 348% and 88%, respectively, from Aug. 1 to their monthly highs.In the near term, whether profits from altcoins will flow into Bitcoin remains in question. Vinokourov noted that the willingness of the market to take on additional risk with altcoins demonstrates a positive market sentiment:“Interestingly, year-to-date (YTD) the MVIS 100 small caps index is up 74.51% and large caps index is up 74.23%. Market’s willingness to take on more risk, as evidenced in capital flow into small cap assets is a net positive overall.”The combination of a favorable high time market structure and positive on-chain data has lifted the sentiment around Bitcoin in the longer term. But in the short term, some predict a minor pullback, which would make the market less overheated."
31,"In a Cointelegraph interview, Adam Back provided additional clarity on his perceived Bitcoin (BTC) maximalism. Blockstream’s CEO believes that Bitcoin is enough and there is no need for a multitude of derivative projects. Back said, “I think it's like TCP/IP the internet exists. We don't need 5800 TCP/IP copies trying to monetize and profiteer off pumpanomics or such. It detracts from value (I gather there are about 5,800 altcoins as of today)”. He noted that innovators should focus on Bitcoin instead:“It's modular, you can build anything you want using it, if you're trying to innovate, go ahead and innovate”, adding “bitcoin is electronic cash for the internet.”Discussing Satoshi rumors, Back noted that it would be unwise for Satoshi to reveal himself “I'm not sure if that would be a wise idea for him, nor for bitcoin”. Yet Back agreed that even if Satoshi were to come back, he would likely not be able to take back control of Bitcoin’s development:“Yes, I think Bitcoin is decentralised enough to reject Satoshi views even if he went nuts.”It became evident that Back’s distaste for ICO projects has not died out when we noted that one of the projects he slammed — Cardano (ADA), prides itself on a scientific approach to development. Back stated that “I would sooner not comment on projects because they fish for marketing quotes.” He continued by alleging that some altcoin critics have received death threats in the past. He also lamented the fate of the volunteers who dare to criticize major altcoin projects on ethical grounds:“Look at the flack a few unfunded volunteers take for even commenting about the ethical considerations, the multi-billion dollar incentive mis-alignment. the people you are commenting on are hugely funded, awash with retail investor cash and looking to perpetuate the game into the next coin.”Finally, we asked Back if there are any crypto or blockchain projects, other than Bitcoin, that he likes. He noted a fondness for some technologies, but again refused to name any names:“There are some technologies I like, in formal security, cryptography like bullet-proofs, simplicity (formal provable smart-contracting), some privacy tech. I don't like to name coins though some have deployed tech I invented over the years.”Back’s maximalism is unlikely to win him many friends in the crypto space. However, with Blockstream dominating Bitcoin discourse, perhaps he does not need friends, only followers."
32,"A resident from Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, was accused by local authorities of attempting to blackmail the supermarket chain, Tesco.According to The Yorkshire Post, Nigel Wright, a sheep farmer, allegedly wrote Tesco a series of letters claiming that he had planted contaminated baby food in their supermarket stores. He then allegedly offered to reveal the locations of the contaminated baby food in exchange for roughly $1.8 million in BTC.Wright is believed to have been a part of a group of disgruntled farmers who felt that the grocery chain had underpaid them for previous goods. No information about other members of the group, who seem to have operated under the name “Guybrush and the Dairy Pirates”, was made available. However, it is worth noting that their name appears to be a reference to the 1990 point-and-click adventure game, “The Secret of Monkey Island.”Prosecutors from the Old Bailey Court charged Wright with two counts of contaminating goods and four counts of blackmail.The report states that Wright initially asked for 100 BTC from Tesco, but later increased the amount to 200 BTC. Authorities additionally allege that Wright threatened to kill a driver with whom he had an altercation, and demanded that he pay $196,350 in Bitcoin.The farmer denied all charges before the judge.Cointelegraph recently reports that the Leicester Crown Court ordered the seizure of over £1.8 million ($2.29 million) from a UK individual who operated a multi-billion crypto drug empire from the attic of his home."

Source: TradingViewThe price correlation between Bitcoin and gold is an oft-discussed topic among analysts, and through July, the price action between the two followed each other to new highs. Thus, it is not surprising that Bitcoin's price is now correcting alongside gold and silver.  Meanwhile, United States markets showed a strong open, with the S&P 500 this morning up by nine points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by 300. This comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order extending federal pandemic relief benefits to furloughed and jobless Americans. “Big Stock Market Numbers!” the president also tweeted today, which coincided with the market’s opening rally. Last week, a breakdown in negotiations between U.S. lawmakers meant that the unemployment benefits expired, as did a moratorium on residence evictions, and some analysts feared this would negatively weigh on markets. While gold, silver and Bitcoin appear to have reached a temporary top, investors might be interpreting Trump’s executive order and the expected second phase of economic stimulus as a sign that the Federal Reserve will continue to bolster the economy until the pandemic abates. Whether or not this is strong enough to encourage investors to drop their hedge in gold, silver and Bitcoin is to be determined. Bitcoin daily price chart.

34,"Reward halvings are a common element of many different forms of cryptocurrency, known to typically impact a coin’s supply, difficulty and price. For many cryptocurrencies, these halving mechanisms are embedded into the code in order to lower the generation rates and inflation, which can help extend the life of the coin even amid increased demand.This is what happened with the Bitcoin network back in May when its block reward halved for the third time and was reduced to 6.25 Bitcoin (BTC). Now, it is Zcash’s turn, as the digital asset’s network is set to undergo its first halving sometime in November — as soon as its 1,046,400th block is mined.Here is a closer look at the upcoming Zcash halving; what it will mean for the world of crypto; and how you can go about maximizing profitability beyond the event.Zcash (ZEC) launched in 2016 as a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses shielded transactions to protect user information. It is currently ranked as the 24th largest crypto by market value according to CoinMarketCap.Like Bitcoin, the total supply of Zcash is capped at 21 million, meaning only 21 million coins can ever be mined into existence. The block reward for Zcash is set to be halved from 6.25 ZEC to 3.125 ZEC later this year — which many expect to help its abnormally high inflation rate.Perhaps the greatest criticism of Zcash to this point has been its inflation rate, which is significantly higher than that of its counterparts — ZEC’s annualized inflation rate is currently standing at 26.53% at the time of writing this article, according to data source ViewBase. This implies that the circulating supply of Zcash increases by approximately 26.5% annually — while most other forms of crypto range from just between 1.8% and 7%.It is expected that the halving will help this, as the inflation rate will essentially be cut in half along with the block reward.With previous halvings of different cryptos, we generally see a positive impact on price both before and after the event — particularly with the three Bitcoin halvings that have taken place up to this point. Analysts expect the halving of Zcash and the subsequent drop in inflation to spark a long-awaited price jump for the asset.When Zcash launched in 2016, it was set up with the following reward allocation:This reward structure faced its share of backlash from the Zcash community. Thankfully, the “founder’s reward,” as it has been known, is set to expire in November alongside the halving. It will be replaced with a new, community-approved fund that looks like this:This new reward structure should benefit the long-term development of the network, but there are still additional steps miners will need to take in order to remain profitable after the halving.The decreased reward and supply following the Zcash halving will lead to increased difficulty and the need for a more highly powered operation in order to maximize profits.There are two key ways to navigate this challenge — finding a more cost-effective miner hosting strategy and upgrading your mining hardware.A great number of users currently rely on Bitmain’s Antminer Z11 and Antminer Z9 in order to meet their Zcash needs — in addition to the Innosilicon A9. These devices will take a big hit following the halving and should look to be replaced with the new, high-powered Antminer Z15.If the Bitcoin halving provided any lesson, it was this: Do not wait to upgrade your hardware, as it could easily be sold out or delayed once the halving hits, forcing you to wait weeks or months to return to profitability. A device upgrade, coupled with a reliable hosting provider, is a strategic solution to remaining profitable this November and beyond.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

36,"Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming investors’ favored escape from fiat misery and punitive economic policy — and central banks are only helping.In a tweet on Aug. 11, popular commentator Holger Zschaepitz described Bitcoin as the “new darling” for those seeking shelter from hurdles such as negative interest rates.The past few months have seen the United States Federal Reserve, in particular, intervene in traditional markets, buying huge swathes of control at a cost of trillions of dollars added to its balance sheet.As the money printing expanded, so did Bitcoin’s value, Zschaepitz noted.“Bitcoin is the new darling among investors in time of negative real rates and as the price of cryptocurrency follows the combined balance sheet of Central Banks,” he summarized.Zschaepitz linked to favorable Bitcoin exposure in German mass media outlet Die Welt, which highlighted belief in Bitcoin over gold and silver by Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad.”Kiyosaki is famous for his Bitcoin support, continuing elsewhere last week as the largest cryptocurrency topped $12,000.“GOLD is up 35% in 2020. S&P only 3%. Silver is still the best, still 30% below all time high. Best because it is limited in quantity, used in industry and still affordable for those with tight budgets,” he tweeted. “The sleeper is Bitcoin.

37,"Bitcoin (BTC) is copying what it did a year before its $20,000 all-time highs, and the new bull market has been here for over a year already.That was according to popular statistician Willy Woo, who this week shed further light on Bitcoin’s current price gains.In a series of tweets on Aug. 10, Woo continued a debate begun by Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song, who himself debated the topic in the latest issue of his Tech Talk blog post series.“Yes. The bull market really started April 2019,” Woo responded, continuing:“What’s started recently is the early main bull phase, it’s Q4 2016 all over again, but different dynamics and themes at play.”BTC/USD hit $12,000 twice in recent days, managing to hold support at $11,500 in a long-awaited show of strength that has given many analysts cause for long-term optimism. Despite failing to flip $12,000 to support, Bitcoin remains firmly bullish, both sentiment and technical fundamentals-based evidence suggests.For Woo, the composition of the market formed a major difference in maturity between this year and 2016 — maturity which has historically dictated both price trajectory and volatility.“One of the themes is the legitimisation of BTC for large institutional funds, and also the easy accessibility to buy crypto for the masses with the likes of square cash, paypal, and not to mention the one I’m working on LVL which is real regulated banking integrated with crypto,” he continued.Woo said that he expected sovereign wealth funds to adopt Bitcoin during the current bull cycle, and continue during the next.He concluded:“I think this cycle BTC gets to prove itself as a legit macro asset bucket for traditional investors, while the cycle after this it overtakes gold to be the significant digital SoV for a digital age.”Bitcoin logarithmic growth curves chart. Source: LookIntoBitcoinThe prognosis chimes with conclusions made by macro investor Dan Tapeiro, who predicted that Bitcoin would seal dramatic gains of five to 10 times its current value during this bull cycle.“Tremendous long term Log Chart of #Bitcoin projects up 5–10x on this run,” he tweeted, uploading a five-year price performance and adding:“Just breaking up NOW. Should last a few years as 2.5yr consolidation is fantastic base for catapult up. Break of old highs will have explosive follow through. Time to sit and be patient.”In May, fellow analyst Positive Crypto argued that Bitcoin had in fact been in an “accumulation” phase for almost 900 days — and that the consolidation would soon be broken, which subsequently happened weeks later.Meanwhile, a survey by quant analyst PlanB revealed increasing bullish sentiment among investors, with over 50% believing that BTC/USD would trade above $100,000 by December 2021.Bitcoin’s price action was “perfectly on track” vis-a-vis his stock-to-flow model, he added previously."
38,"A major financial watchdog in Russia is developing a new cryptocurrency analytics tool to trace major cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) and privacy coins.Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service, a federal service combating money laundering and terrorist financing, is reportedly planning to build a new analytics platform for tracking cryptocurrency transactions via artificial intelligence.Dubbed “Transparent Blockchain,” the new system is designed to track the movement of digital financial assets and identify crypto service providers to fight illicit activity related to digital assets, local news agency RBC reported on Aug. 10.According to the report, the new system is able to “partially reduce anonymity” of transactions involving major coins like Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Omni (OMNI) as well as privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Dash (DASH) and Monero (XMR).As reported, the financial regulator has successfully piloted a prototype system to fight drug trafficking. The system was developed in collaboration with a major Russian research institute, the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the report notes. The project has reportedly been funded by extra-budgetary resources so far, but would require additional funding. According to preliminary data, the Russian “Transparent Blockchain” will require about 760 million rubles ($10.3 million) from the federal budget from 2021 until 2023. The targeted customers of the new platform reportedly include major financial institutions like Russia’s central bank.The news comes shortly after Russia officially passed its major cryptocurrency-related bill “On Digital Financial Assets.” Set to be adopted in January 2021, the new law prohibits the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a payment method. Earlier in August, Russia’s lawmakers passed new amendments to the law “On National Payment System,” banning anonymous deposits to major online wallets like Yandex, WebMoney, PayPal and Kiwi."
39,"A new cryptocurrency scam in India is targeting wealthy individuals using a fake mobile app.According to India TV News, cybercriminals are targeting high income individuals across India.

Once a user’s Bitcoin is deposited on the fake exchange, the scammers stop responding to queries from the victim and disappear.Manan Shah, founder and CEO of Avalance Global Solutions, said that an unidentified man lost over $50,000 while dealing with one of the fake platforms. One of the most significant cases involved another unnamed Indian businessman who was scammed out of the USD equivalent of $3 million.Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of local crypto exchange CoinDCX, believes that more fraudulent crypto services will appear as Blockchain-based assets continue to grow in popularity throughout India.Cointelegraph previously reported that Indian police have registered a case against five individuals suspected of involvement in a cryptocurrency scam that has defrauded investors since 2017.Despite operating for several years, the scammers are only believed to have made off with a modest bounty of $34,200."
40,"Bitcoin (BTC) mining activity doesn’t seem to be reacting to the recent price rally that took the asset from approximately $9,000 in early July to almost $12,000 at time of publication.According to data from Coinmetrics, hashrate spiked around July 7 and has remained largely flat amid fluctuations to the downside. Bitcoin Hashrate (green) vs. Difficulty (red), 7-day average. Source: CoinmetricsThe hashrate represents the sum total of all miners attempting to find hashes that would create new valid blocks. There is generally a strong correlation between hashrate and price, as a higher BTC value increases the profit margins for each individual miner. Since July, hashrate growth appears to have slowed down as the difficulty saw its first decline since early June. The trough in hashrate in mid-July, right after a significant difficulty increase, suggests that the balancing mechanism overshot. Difficulty was set too high for the available hashrate, slowing down block production.While for most of July Bitcoin’s price remained steady, it crept up until a dramatic rally took it to highs of $11,500 in the second half of the month. Hashrate is sitting below all-time highs even as two weeks passed since the major leg of the rally.During protracted rallies, hashrate tends to trail price as the supply of new miners is constrained by physical supply chains. However, the industry is currently experiencing additional disruptions stemming from the power struggle at Bitmain. As Cointelegraph reported previously, shipments of new mining devices are being halted for at least three months. News of the disruption broke amidst the ongoing struggle for company dominance between Bitmain’s two co-founders, Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan. Bitmain is one of the biggest manufacturers of ASIC devices, though competitors like MicroBT have been hot on their tail since the start of 2020.As delivery of new devices is halted, a significant chunk of the ASIC supply is being restricted. At the same time, the rally rendered the old S9 series of miners slightly profitable at electricity prices of $0.04, according to Asicminervalue.As Bitmain competitors scale their operations up and old miners are gradually turned back on, it is likely that the hashrate will resume growth."

Max Keiser believes that capital fleeing Asia is one of the main reasons for the sharp rally in Bitcoin (BTC). Let’s analyze the charts of the major cryptocurrencies to find out whether the uptrend is likely to resume or if it time for a correction to start.The bulls are attempting to push Bitcoin above the overhead resistance of $12,113.50, which is a positive sign. This suggests that the bulls are not booking profits yet, which is frustrating the traders who have been left out because they are forced to buy at higher levels.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewBoth moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is in the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls are in command.A breakout and close (in UTC) above $12,113.50 is likely to resume the uptrend. There is a minor resistance at $12,304.37, but that is likely to be crossed. Above this level, the uptrend can reach $13,000, and above it, $14,000.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears aggressively defend the $12,113.50 level, the BTC/USD pair might correct to the 20-day exponential moving average of $11,052. A strong bounce off this level will increase the possibility of a break above the overhead resistance. However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will signal weakness. Below this level, a retest of the $10,400 level is possible. A drop below this support will signal that the bears are back in the game.Ether has been trading above the breakout level of $366 for the past few days — a huge positive, as it shows that the bulls are not hurrying to liquidate their positions.

A breakout and close above $415.634 will signal a resumption of the uptrend toward the next target of $480.However, if the bears defend the $415.634 resistance, the ETH/USD pair might spend some more time inside the range.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $366. Such a move will suggest a weakening momentum that can drag the price to the 20-day EMA of $351. A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to 61.8% and a Fibonacci retracement level of $304.367.XRP is currently trading inside a falling wedge pattern, which usually acts as a bullish setup.

Above this resistance, a rally to $353 is possible. A breakout of this level could resume the uptrend to $400.Chainlink (LINK) dipped on Aug. 7 to $9.05, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. By close, the price had recovered sharply from the intraday lows, which shows aggressive buying by the bulls.LINK/USD daily chart.

The LINK/USD pair rose to a high of $14.4586 on Aug. 9, which is just below the 200% Fibonacci extension level of $14.8537. The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance in the $14.4586–$14.8537 zone, while the RSI has also risen into the deep overbought zone, suggesting a minor consolidation or correction.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls continue to buy at higher levels and push the price above the resistance zone, a rally to the 261.8% Fibonacci extension level of $17.4319 is possible. The bulls are struggling to push Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the $240 resistance, which suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.

On the other hand, if the BSV/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will once again attempt to push the price above $240. If successful, a move to $260.86 is likely. Litecoin (LTC) has roughly been trading between the $56–$60 level since Aug. 2. This suggests a balance between demand and supply. However, as both moving averages are rising and the RSI is in the positive zone, the advantage is with the bulls.LTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the LTC/USD pair rises above $60, the advantage will shift in favor of the bulls. Above this level, a rally to $65.1573 is possible.

A break below this support will signal a possible change in trend but if the bulls buy the dip to this support, the pair might remain range-bound for a few more days. Cardano (ADA) turned down from the $0.15–$0.1543051 resistance zone on Aug. 9, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending this zone.

42,"Satoshi Nakamoto years ago envisioned an ecosystem that would be independent of the centralized financial system that dominates the global economy today. His creation sparked a global community of enthusiasts and an entire industry surrounding blockchain — the solution enabling individuals to turn their money away from centralized legacy institutions and toward transacting on a decentralized, distributed ledger. The ultimate goal was a world in which people could pay for goods and services with these novel financial instruments.Many payment companies and exchanges already claim to offer services that enable crypto users to buy goods and services with cryptocurrency. Upon further analysis, however — like with Binance’s new debit card offer — it’s clear their crypto payment solutions don’t deliver on the blockchain, adding more intermediaries and opening users to the same harm that could befall them digitally using traditional payment methods. Currently, there are two mainstream methods of processing a cryptocurrency-fiat transaction. One method involves the intermediary accepting cryptocurrency and converting it into fiat at a locked-in, instantaneous exchange rate and then delivering fiat to the merchant or vice versa. The second method involves first liquidating the user’s crypto into fiat in the user’s account before it reaches the intermediary and then sending the fiat payment to the intermediary to complete the transaction. The first method takes place on the blockchain, while the second does not.Numerous payment platforms offer one of the two aforementioned types of transactions. Even the giants are mulling over jumping into the game. PayPal has weighed the idea lately of offering crypto payments to consumers, which could lead the way to increased stabilization of the volatility often associated with Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. But it remains to be seen exactly how these payment providers plan to process the transactions — whether they would technically allow consumers to pay in crypto or in fiat on or off the blockchain. That’s an important difference to crypto users.Crypto enthusiasts, as well as regular consumers who like to pay in crypto, value the secure nature of blockchain, which, on top of the clear security benefits, doesn’t include the hidden administrative fees that credit cards do, such as chargebacks or non-purchase credit card fees. There are also personal reasons consumers choose to purchase with crypto: the advantage of having full control of their money on a blockchain, an element that is arguably missing from non-blockchain means of storing or transferring financial assets where banks have control. This is the foundation and spirit of cryptocurrency ownership for many crypto users. Some crypto payment solutions available to crypto users, however, have diminished this foundation by the way in which they execute transactions.Most recently, Binance announced a partnership with Swipe, in essence acquiring the company. Through the acquisition, Binance account holders can now be issued a Binance-branded Visa card. Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, explained:""To achieve our mission of making crypto more accessible to the masses, off-ramps are a key component as well. By giving users the ability to convert and spend crypto directly, and have merchants still seamlessly accept fiat, this will make the crypto experience much better for everyone.”According to the company’s marketing, the card can then be used to purchase goods or services from merchants that accept Visa, giving the impression that the consumer is paying the merchant with cryptocurrency — but there’s a catch. Upon deeper analysis, it’s clear the account holders are not really buying anything with cryptocurrency nor are they making the purchase on the blockchain. This payment method only makes it appear as though the consumer is paying using cryptocurrency. In actuality, the charge is to the customer’s fiat account.A source close to Binance explained that if the fiat account is empty, Binance’s system converts cryptocurrency from the user’s crypto account into fiat currency. The converted fiat currency is then deposited into the fiat account and used to make the purchase with the Binance debit card. In the transaction, Binance sends the converted fiat currency to the card company to complete the payment process. So, technically, the payment never truly involves paying with crypto or on the blockchain.There are two conceptual problems here. First, the crypto liquidation process into fiat currency through Binance, which is similar to banking mechanisms, is out of the control of the user, negating the foundational spirit of owning cryptocurrency instead of holding cash at a bank — not to mention the unnecessary redundancy it creates by adding Binance, Swipe and Visa as additional intermediaries in the transaction process.Second, by sending the payment through traditional credit card rails that are not on the blockchain, the user loses the security benefits of paying on the blockchain. Essentially, the whole process places Binance in a sort of bank-like position rather than a facilitator of payment between the user and the merchant, which is what Visa or Mastercard serve in this example.To satisfy the crypto community’s hunger for a truly decentralized digital currency, users need to know they are paying in crypto, and not be deluded by the promise of it. This means crypto payment platforms need to ensure they are accepting the payment as crypto and not converting the crypto to fiat before sending payment to merchants — an act that undermines the element of transaction transparency to the user.The most cryptocurrency-user-friendly approach would involve accepting cryptocurrency and instantly locking in a rate that the user will see before paying. Such a mechanism would restore transparency and grant the user full control of the digital currency, while also ensuring that the transaction stays on-chain, thereby reaping its benefits.These may seem like negligible details, but to a cryptocurrency owner, it can make a world of difference. The entire reason for which users get into crypto revolves around control of the currency and the multitude of benefits of running transactions on a blockchain for both the consumer and merchant. For exchanges and crypto payment providers, the key is to stick to the crypto and blockchain way, rather than creating an illusion. This is true to Satoshi’s vision.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Joshua Tate is the CEO of ForumPay.

Essentially, we're back into the ranging gameplan,” he told his Twitter followers. “Ranging” within a certain price corridor has become a feature of BTC/USD in 2020, with recent gains upending a protracted period, which slowly narrowed to point — a process known as compression.Going forward, lower levels could see a retest, with significant support just above $10,000 still apt to form the price floor, Van de Poppe thinks.“Larger timeframe; still expecting such a scenario,” he continued. “If we break $12K however, I assume we'll see $13k.”Attention will thus now focus on bulls’ ability to cement $12,000 as a support zone, something that has yet to occur on any meaningful level for Bitcoin. Nonetheless, the latest weekly close marked the highest since January 2018 and the initial fall from Bitcoin’s all-time highs of $20,000."

Source: Coin360Bitcoin’s price surge comes the week after United States president Donald Trump added to existing geopolitical tensions by banning Chinese social media platform TikTok. The resulting escalation of ties with Beijing adds to existing weakness in the U.S. dollar and ongoing concerns over Coronavirus — a perfect storm for a flight to safe haven assets.At the same time, Trump signed a series of executive orders on Coronavirus stimulus, something which now has a curious impact on markets which are already subject to heavy intervention from the Federal Reserve. This time around, however, the measures will have a smaller direct effect on the average American. A payroll tax delay, for example, does not go far enough in the eyes of critics.“This fake tax cut would also be a big shock to workers who thought they were getting a tax cut when it was only a delay,” Bloomberg quoted Democratic Senator Ron Wyden as saying in a statement.“These workers would be hit with much bigger payments down the road.”It is this delaying the inevitable financial cost to personal wealth, which lies at the heart of the pro-Bitcoin argument — high-time-preference economic behavior ultimately costs much more in the long term than the immediate benefit to the target audience.Where Bitcoin might head in the short term is now less clear cut when considering its historical performance versus other macro assets.The period since March, which saw a cross-asset crash, was marked first by a correlation to stock markets, and then to safe havens and specifically gold.Gold hit its all-time highs in U.S. dollar terms weeks before Bitcoin began significantly gaining, and its run has continued — until now.A slight correction took XAU/USD to $2,030 from highs of near $2,075 — should the trend continue, Bitcoin may likewise cool off from its upward momentum.Nonetheless, as Cointelegraph reported, incoming action from the Fed looks set to buoy the precious metal further in a “wildly bullish” policy shift to expanding inflation way beyond its current rate of 0.6%.Stocks were likewise looking less stable — analysts were warning over fallout for developing markets thanks to Turkey’s currency crisis, and China sanctioning U.S. officials over Hong Kong added to pressure.“Bitcoin up as tensions rise in Asia. Capital flight out of Asia taking the Bitcoin express,” RT host Max Keiser summarized, adding: “You can’t take it with you, unless it’s Bitcoin - then you can take IT ALL with you (Something near impossible with Gold).”Another volatile weekend has opened up a classic feature for short-term Bitcoin price forecasting — a “gap” in CME Bitcoin futures markets.The weekend’s volatility means that futures finished Friday at $11,680 and began again at $11,750. The resulting void provides a key price target, with Bitcoin historically filling such “gaps” within days or even hours.Last week saw just such a setup emerge, with volatility aiding the trend after weeks of flat price action removed gaps from the market altogether.Another gap lower down at $9,700 still remains from July.CME Bitcoin futures chart showing recent latest gaps.

45,"Frankie MacDonald, an amateur meteorologist based in Nova Scotia, has recently been using his platform to talk up Bitcoin in his charismatic voice.In a series of tweets beginning Aug. 8, MacDonald posted videos stating his views on the cryptocurrency to his 118,500 followers. The Canadian weatherman said that Bitcoin (BTC) is “worth more than American dollars,” taking viewers through the numbers if they owned anywhere from 1 BTC — $12,007 as of press time — to 10 million BTC, or over $160 billion at the time.The 36-year-old YouTuber began making videos on the platform in 2009, which focused on meteorology in Canada and the United States. MacDonald gained momentum online, standing out with his unique style of forecasts. After seeing a video of MacDonald shouting “Bitcoin” on Aug. 7, the crypto community has quickly picked up on the Canadian’s charisma and turned him into a new meme as the token surged past $12,000 on Aug. 10.We are above $12k 🍾Now do the same as @frankiemacd & open your window and scream out loud ""Biiiiiiitcoiiiiiiiin"" 🔊🔊🔊 pic.twitter.com/js62M8E6ZoOne of MacDonald’s mantras, featured in the title of his book and one of his songs, is “be prepared.” He has yet to associate the phrase with the volatility of cryptocurrency.A number of high-profile individuals not normally associated with cryptocurrency have been bullish on Bitcoin lately. After speaking with Anthony Pompliano on his July 1 podcast, comedian Bill Burr said he would be investing in Bitcoin for the first time. Podcaster and celebrity Joe Rogan has been using his platform to talk up the cryptocurrency to his more than 200 million listeners as part of his sponsorship with Cash App.Even online personalities with more of a connection to the financial sector are speaking out. Cointelegraph reported on Aug. 4 that Dave Portnoy enlisted the help of Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss regarding Bitcoin.

47,"The president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, who once claimed the Federal Reserve was flush with cash, called for a nationwide lockdown to fight COVID-19. In an op-ed in The New York Times, Neel Kashkari and co-writer Michael T. Osterholm of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota said a more restrictive lockdown of up to six weeks is necessary to fight the virus and save the economy. Kashkari and Osterholm said the U.S. “gave up on our lockdown efforts to control virus transmission well before the virus was under control.” For them, there is no trade-off between health and the economy, but, for a lockdown to truly work, only truly essential workers must be allowed to work. They said the problem with the earlier lockdowns from March to May was that some states deemed a large portion of its population essential workers. But the Economic Policy Institute said only 39% of workers in the U.S. are essential. “If we aren’t willing to take this action, millions more cases with many more deaths are likely before a vaccine might be available. In addition, the economic recovery will be much slower, with far more business failures and high unemployment for the next year or two. The path of the virus will determine the path of the economy. There won’t be a robust economic recovery until we get control of the virus.”Kashkari previously said the Fed had infinite cash. As Cointelegraph previously reported, this kind of quantitative easing strategy provides long-term benefits for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The pandemic and economic recessions usually offer people ample opportunities to invest in non-traditional assets such as crypto. Lockdowns due to COVID-19 vary state by state. For example, New York entered Phase 4 of re-opening as of July 20, allowing the opening of zoos, resumption of sporting activities sans spectators, and the resumption of film production activities. Some states, however, paused reopening."

49,"Although over two months have passed since the halving happened on the Bitcoin network, the crypto mining industry is still heaving from the frantic pace of events that have followed suit. The rollercoaster of hash rates has left Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) prices soaring while provoking mixed feelings among crypto miners.The COVID-19 pandemic has left its mark on the industry as well, forcing dozens of pools to either switch off or shift their focus from Bitcoin, with its increasing mining difficulty, to less complicated altcoins that are trailing the Big Daddy of crypto.The impending launch of Ethereum 2.0 is giving food for thought for all miners in their strive to maintain profitability in light of the challenges facing the mining hardware market. After the Bitcoin halving and the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, private miners were left reeling, but large manufacturers were also affected. Will the upcoming Ethereum upgrade aggravate the situation for mining device producers, or is it just another milestone that will be easy to adapt to?The Bitcoin halving resulted in a serious cleansing in the mining market, with small miners losing all sense of remaining, but the near extinction of private farms was not followed by a significant reduction in major pools.Alejandro De La Torre, vice president of the Poolin mining pool, stated that 15% to 30% of private miners producing Bitcoin’s hash rate are under immense pressure to remain afloat and are gradually shutting down. A decline of up to 20% in the hash rate is also expected in the short term, with an average daily drop of 6.5%. In total, the hash rate seesawed after the halving from highs of 135 exahashes per second to 98 EH/s, or a 27% decline. But that did not affect interest in the cryptocurrency, as institutions poured into the derivatives market, with Bitcoin options open interest increasing by 1,200% over two weeks.The Chinese factor in the statistical field cannot be ignored — Chinese pools make up to 65% of all of Bitcoin’s hash rate. The pandemic has had its impact on the local mining industry, forcing more than 40 production facilities to stop deliveries. The delays have had a major effect on all miners, as older versions of mining rigs could not be replaced with newer equipment that could have increased the hash rate and compensated for the halved reward and increased difficulty requirements.The drop in the price of Bitcoin in May from $10,500 to $8,100 saw the shutting down of almost 2.3 million Antminer S9 mining rigs, which is clearly reflected in the drop in hash rates from China, where most old mining equipment became unprofitable and was sold for scrap.Although the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic at the start of 2020 affected supply chains and halted the operations of major mining equipment manufacturers, the disruption did not last long, as companies in China and South Korea — home to the largest manufacturers — quickly resumed deliveries. Bitmain launched deliveries from Malaysia of its chips produced in Taiwan and Korea, while Whatsminer rushed a new model onto the market to compensate for lost time and profits.After resuming business in February, Hangzhou-based Canaan also announced the launch of AvalonMiner 1066 Pro, its latest chip model boasting a computing power of 55 terahashes per second.Powerry, a cryptocurrency mining operator with 100 megawatts of capacity, announced the expansion of its capabilities by placing a $20 million order for new mining hardware. The equipment will be provided by Bitmain and MicroBt, while farm powering will be handed to Genesis Mining’s enterprise crypto-mining-farm software HEXA.It is thus possible to conclude that even the expansion of the pandemic’s effects on the world will not have a significant impact on the manufacturers of mining software, which will be under pressure to deliver more new mining rigs to miners seeking to keep pace with industry requirements. The most that can be expected in the event of a second wave of the pandemic is delivery delays and increased equipment prices, which the producers would only benefit from.The pandemic has not affected the operations of the largest Chinese mining farms, as any disruption would have undermined the Bitcoin network’s hash rate. But even the worst-case scenario of a China-wide shutdown is not likely to result in serious losses, as other miners will pick up the opportunity and keep the hash rate steady. A possible drop in the hash rate of major currencies due to the shutdown of Chinese farms would lead to digital money becoming approximately twice as easy to mine, and the profitability of mining would double.On the one hand, the volatility of altcoins can play into the hands of miners. With the rise in the price of Bitcoin, other digital assets trail it even faster, thus significantly improving the economics of their production.Experts believe that Bitcoin will remain the most suitable cryptocurrency for mining in the long term, despite the halving, because its price is more stable than that of altcoins, which can devalue sharply. Those still willing to stay in the mining game can opt for safer assets with high liquidity and capitalization, such as Litecoin (LTC) and Dash.Rashit Makhat, co-founder of Powerry, stated:“As a result of the Bitcoin block halving that took place on May 11, 2020, the block reward [...] was halved. In order to stay ahead on the market, miners must promptly update their equipment fleet. The most popular machines until 2020 – S9 ceased to be profitable for miners from almost any region, including regions with low energy costs, such as China.”The price of BTC seems to be of little consolation for many, as Valarhash — which operates some of China’s largest mining pools — decided to switch to altcoin mining.Despite the recent 33% hike in Bitcoin’s hash rate, Valarhash dropped its contribution to the network from 4,000 to 200 petahashes per second in March. The company’s mining pools Bytepool and 1THash, which at one point accounted for 9% of the total Bitcoin hash rate, have had their processing power redirected to other coins.The transition to altcoins may require a significant upgrade of mining farms. Investments in equipment for mining ETH and LTC have longer payback periods compared with BTC mining equipment. Mining ETH and LTC requires higher operating margins, and the equipment is more expensive. Scrypt-based altcoins like LTC cannot compete with Bitcoin in terms of profitability and return on investment. As such, the upcoming transition of Ethereum to proof-of-stake is unlikely to usher in a revolution for the industry.Despite the technical setbacks spawned by the halving, Bitcoin is likely to remain the cryptocurrency of choice for mining for years to come. The main reason is the relative stability of its price in comparison with altcoins, which are far too volatile to be reliable as profit-fixing assets.In the long term, miners will become less dependent on events such as halvings. With the development of the coin’s infrastructure, the reward for processing transactions on the network will increase and, over time, may exceed the reward for finding blocks.As for the manufacturers, they will keep churning out equipment and offering both attractive prices and upgrades to stay afloat and adapt to the rapidly changing requirements of various networks.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Sarah Austin is head of content for Kava Labs, a DeFi-for-crypto startup company based in Silicon Valley.

50,"China’s dominance in Bitcoin mining may not last as more mining chips are produced and other countries offer cheap power sources, said cypherpunk Jameson Lopp in a blog post. Lopp noted China has a virtual monopoly on Bitcoin mining mainly because most of the facilities that manufacture of mining chips are in Asia and its cheap power.“Over the very long term I expect we will see semiconducter foundries outside of Asia begin producing more mining chips and countries with even cheaper power sources will continue to become more industrialized, thus providing more competition when miners are seeking out new locations to set up shop. China's mining dominance is unlikely to last.”Decentralizing mining from mining pools gives individual hashers more control, Lopp said. He points to two projects already implementing further decentralization to Bitcoin: Betterhash and Stratum V2. Despite China’s mining dominance, however, Lopp still believes the country doesn’t entirely pose a threat to Bitcoin. Even if a state actor wants to seize control of all mining activity, there are far too many independent observers on the Bitcoin network. As it is, Lopp said, bots exist that monitor orphaned blocks. Any action by a state or even an individual bad actor immediately gets noticed. “It's hard to imagine a scenario in which a state actor would be able to quickly and covertly seize enough hashpower to perform an ongoing attack that lasts more than a few hours. A worst case scenario in which state actors did seize all of the physical equipment could result in China only mining empty blocks and orphaning other blocks that did contain transactions, essentially halting all transaction confirmations on the network. Then it would become a game of either patiently waiting for them to give up or coordinating a code change that would make their hashing machines worthless.”Other countries are vying for a piece of the Bitcoin mining market. The Iranian government approved a national strategy for mining owing to its affordable electricity offerings."
51,"Facial recognition can help prevent future Bitcoin (BTC) scams like those that hit Twitter and YouTube, said Rod Hsu, president and co-founder of virtual currency platform Coincurve. During an interview with Cointelegraph, Hsu said Bitcoin is an electronic form of currency that is non-reversible and somewhat anonymous, “coupled with this gap in understanding makes it appealing for scam artists.” But because of the negative publicity the cryptocurrency got with the scams, it may have discouraged many from adopting it. “Due to the nature of this, people may see scams and Bitcoin being synonymous. In either traditional payment methods or Bitcoin, it's up to the individual to understand the situation and determine its legitimacy. With more public awareness of these schemes and education on Bitcoin, we hope to decouple that negative association.”Hsu believes facial recognition is one possible solution to stamp out Bitcoin fraud since it is much harder to duplicate. He adds that such a system relies on biometrics, which is “much more advanced than simply a photo image”:“We have seen a light version of facial recognition where not only does a consumer provide their identification, but also they perform a Liveness check which takes multiple angles of a person's profile. This adds a layer of difficulty if someone is attempting to use another person's payment instrument.”Hsu added that facial recognition is a good tool to use when re-authenticating a person once they have been initially verified, “balancing the goal of better user experience while minimizing fraud.”However, Coincurve’s co-founder warns that systems like facial recognition should keep ethics top of mind for verification purposes:“I think the ethics surrounding facial recognition boils down to consent and security. With consent, the user must be aware, provide consent, and be in control, of how the data is being stored, shared, used, and accessed as well as the ability to remove it at any time. With security, this relates to how that data is stored and safety protocols implemented. These requirements may shift based on the age of the end-user as well.”Services need to consider these considerations when leveraging new technology, such as facial recognition since the implementation will affect many layers of the service from “the user experience through to the architecture and security of the system,” Hsu added."

Such previously questionable practices like remote jobs or crypto payments have become of significant importance and seem like they will remain present even after the pandemic ends. Why work from the office when everything can be efficiently managed from any spot in the world? Does it make sense to continue to overspend on luxurious offices if there is simply no need for that in the digital age?Moreover, it’s about time to get rid of cash — we have to take a step toward a new quality of life. Meanwhile, the blockchain field has also blossomed, as a new era requires more professionals in the field of distributed ledger technology. In today’s world, apps for interaction with the crypto world have become advanced and straightforward enough to enable the purchase of digital assets with just a credit card. Stablecoin wallets are in high demand, and this evident trend is no more a millennial-only kind of thing as institutions join the club in substantial numbers.The image of cryptocurrency is changing globally faster than ever. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are not a bubble anymore, as BTC’s market capitalization is now bigger than Coca-Cola and Intel, and blockchain is integrated into many fields and operations. Moreover, institutional crypto involvement is rising as the demand for Bitcoin soars amid the coronavirus crisis, with Grayscale experiencing a drastic increase in assets this year. More hedge funds are accumulating digital wealth fast — and that is sure to continue this year.While the Facebook-led Libra project still has many stumbling blocks in the face of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators, its launch is continually delayed. Because mixing different monetary policies is questionable for the project’s success, we’re not sure that Libra will ever see the light of the day in the current condition.One thing is undoubtedly evident: The world of mainstream users needs more convenient interfaces to interact with crypto — and they are coming. The digital divide steadily reduces, as in 2020, it’s easier to open a checking account in dollars or euros than ever before. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, has become one of the most prominent trends in crypto since late 2019. The sector has been growing at a fast pace over the past six months, and a new milestone was recently reached by the sector as the total value locked in DeFi hit an astonishing new height of $4 billion.Many companies that operate in the blockchain field have already introduced their DeFi products. Popular protocols such as Compound, Balancer, Curve and other platforms have opened the door to a whole new world of crypto opportunities for investors looking for deep liquidity, varying risk-reward ratios, and exciting, affordable modern financial instruments.We’re about to see further adoption alongside user-base growth as institutional capital comes to the digital asset field. DeFi is growing insanely fast, and it’s of crucial importance to have a simple, effective, inexpensive on-ramp and off-ramp solution for this segment.Nowadays, central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, are either a hot topic to talk about or a solution in development in many countries. China, one of the world’s most extensive tech breeding grounds, has started to engage in creating the local digital asset. It would be exciting to see how a digital yuan launch and implementation could change the crypto world and shift the balance of economic power, taking out the dollar’s status as a global reserve currency. Could this example inspire other leading countries? The competition may be fierce in this field.Stablecoins initiatives are still massively underappreciated throughout the world — most crypto holders are subject to volatility and counterparty risk. It’s not only global or local bank-lead projects that will be in the space in the future, as private companies are continuing developments as well. Projects such as USD Coin (USDC), Paxos Standard (PAX) and Stasis’ Eurs combine the benefits of blockchain with the reputation and relative stability of fiat. Real progress happens when a crisis looms ahead. Back in the 90s, the internet was something of a miracle, magic or an arcane invention. Today, in the mobile-driven age of social media networks, we can hardly imagine our daily existence without the need to interact or communicate online. But with the growing engagement in digital life, we forget that all the available services, which are being used not only by casual users but also by most well-known CEOs and even presidents, are still too fragile, despite technological advances.The latest Twitter hack compromised many high-level politicians, celebrities and individuals in technology. The problem leads to the question of what to do next. Discussions on blockchain-based improvements have heated up in a blink of an eye. We may see more problems, as hacking activity and ransom demands in crypto will not vanish anytime soon. Still, DLT will surely be noted when developing a shield for this particular dagger.Many analysts make distant forecasts for the crypto field and the price of Bitcoin, envisioning the further possible trends of the next decade. It’s undeniable that this once niche field is set to transform into a global mainstream ecosystem. Be sure to expect more price records, more inventions and more adoption.What will the world be like in 10 years? Back in the 20th century, this question was much easier to address, but any predictions made today will highly likely become obsolete after a year. However, we can be sure that decentralized technologies and DLT-driven services will shape humanity’s further progress and development.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Gregory Klumov is a stablecoin expert whose insights and opinions appear regularly in numerous international publications.

53,"According to the Buffett Indicator, the global stock market has entered a “bubble territory,” says Welt market analyst Holger Zschaepitz on Aug. 9. The recent correlation between Bitcoin and stocks could mean BTC is also at risk of a pullback.The global stock market enters bubble territory. Source: Holger Zschaepitz, BloombergStocks have continuously rallied in recent weeks, buoyed by the surging appetite for risk-on assets. In the past month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose from 25,706 points to 27,433, by 6.7%.The Buffett Indicator measures the stock market’s valuation by dividing its market cap by the United States’ GDP. It attempts to find a fair valuation of stocks relative to the U.S. economy. When the indicator is above 100, it signals that the stock market is heading into bubble territory.Since April, after the pandemic began, U.S. stocks surged due to favorable market conditions and multi-trillion dollar stimulus. Specifically, tech stocks substantially outperformed the rest of the stock market, pushing the market upward.Due to various macro factors, the valuations of tech stocks are at historically high levels, relative to their earnings. Consequently, global markets entered bubble territory for the first time in 2018. Zschaepitz said:“Global stock mkts have hit another milestone. All stocks now worth more than 100% of global GDP for the 1st time since 2018, pointing to stretched valuations. For Warren Buffett, a Market Cap to GDP Ratio >100% means stocks in bubble territory.”There is no conclusive link between stocks and Bitcoin other than BTC has followed the trend of stocks in the past four months. Data from Skew shows that since early July, Bitcoin closely resembled the performance of the S&P 500.If stocks begin to drop as investors seek safety in bonds and treasuries fearing an overvalued market, it could negatively affect Bitcoin. The momentum of the stock market remains strong, and during a bullish trend, the market can remain overheated for prolonged periods.The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500.

54,"With about 800 crypto funds relying on a new asset class, which has its own properties, it is essential to assess them through an appropriate framework. We provide a basic framework of useful metrics to assess the true risk of a crypto fund as a quantitative screening tool. Short-listed funds can then be assessed in more detail through a classic due diligence process.Investors in a directional fund should first have a clear understanding of the dynamic of the fund’s overall strategy in order to realize where the performance will come from and over what period before assessing whether the risk taken to achieve such results is worth it. This is achieved through discussions with the fund manager.Warning: If a fund manager refuses to explain any of the fund’s strategies, beware!When asking about a fund’s strategies, a truthful and experienced manager should be able to explain it in plain English. If a fund manager doesn’t want to disclose anything stating that it’s a trade secret, you could still try to understand what the fund tries to achieve by analyzing its past track record. However, in such a case, it’s unlikely that the manager will provide daily returns of the strategy for a more granular analysis, which may thus be worthless.A transparent fund manager inspires trust, a secretive one inspires defiance, but even if a manager is transparent about strategy, investors should verify that these pitches from fund managers are credible and not take their word for granted. The Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme was just that. Madoff explained that he was trading S&P 100 options as the basis of his strategy. Why not? But given the size of this specific market (~$100 million daily on average), there was no way he could have been trading the size of his fund ($6 billion), but he still lured many naïve investors.Directional funds try to achieve their goals in different ways, and investors have to understand in which market environments they are going to perform well or not; some funds may perform very well during smooth trending markets but can be crushed during times of high volatility, whereas funds performing well during hectic markets can dramatically underperform in strong trending markets.No single strategy can perform well in every market environment, as each strategy is designed to only fully capture specific moves and avoid being crushed otherwise. Directional funds tend to embed different strategies, each designed to capture specific market moves; but since these strategies are usually blended together, the resulting blend should perform well during most market environments, but will always underperform the best single strategy in a given market environment.Understanding the timeframe through which a fund strategy works — i.e., intraday and/or on a several-day basis — and the broad expectations of the strategy in terms of capturing market movements — e.g., captures 80% of an upward move, 30% of a downward move on average — are necessary to make a meaningful comparison against a potential benchmark.In the example just quoted, such a fund would underperform a passive index representative of the traded underlying asset during strong upward movements but should prove its value when the passive index reverses course by limiting the losses, leading to a better performance against the passive index but over a full up/down market cycle. In order to assess the risk profile of a directional fund, an advanced — i.e., nonlinear — hedge fund analysis framework is useful, but metrics of a crypto fund cannot be compared with the metrics of a traditional hedge fund — e.g., volatility, Sharpe ratio, etc.We will assume that the past behavior of a fund is expected to continue more or less in the near future if the manager’s strategy is robust and well designed.If an instrument behaves the same during different market conditions, it is said to have a linear behavior, but if it behaves differently during different market conditions, it is said to have a nonlinear behavior.For example, when a fund gains 1% every time the broad market gains 1% and loses 1% every time the broad market losses 1%, it is linear; but when a fund gains 1% every time the broad market gains 1% and loses 2% every time the broad market losses 1%, it is nonlinear, as its behavior during negative markets doesn’t have the same amplitude as during positive markets.The question is: “Is a given fund linear or nonlinear?” The quick answer is that most active funds will be nonlinear, but there’s a statistical test to answer the question more precisely, the Jarque–Bera test for normality.However, metrics from a nonlinear framework can also be used to assess linear instruments, but not the other way around. The four main metrics of a linear framework adapted to assess nonlinear asset behaviors are volatility, correlation, beta and value at risk. Simple time series are used in the section below to illustrate the purpose.Volatility measures the degree of dispersion of returns around their mean. The higher the volatility, the higher the dispersion of the returns. If an asset has a linear behavior, a high dispersion of returns around their mean indicates that returns can be far above but also far below their mean, and this is generally considered as an easily understandable measure of risk. However, if the asset has a nonlinear behavior, overall volatility can be highly misleading, either over or underestimating the risk of loss.In order to assess the behavior of a nonlinear asset from a volatility point of view, we will split the metric into two sub-metrics: positive volatility and negative volatility. Positive volatility is a classic volatility measure but is only applied to the positive returns of the asset. Likewise, negative volatility is a classic volatility measure but is only applied to the negative returns of the asset. Thus, we assess the dispersion of the returns on the positive side and on the negative side. If the asset is linear, these two metrics are close to each other.Example: Let’s consider three funds, A, B and C as having had the following returns over the same period:Fund A: { -3%; -8%; 5%; 58%; -1%; 2; 48%; -2%; 1%; 38% }Fund B: { -3%; -8%; 5%; 12%; -1%; 2; 6%; -2%; 1%; 4% }Fund C: { -45%; -8%; 5%; 12%; -1%; 2; 6%; -2%; 1%; 4% }The volatility of Fund B is 5.3%, whereas the volatility of Fund A is 23.1%. Thus, if considering the overall volatility as a risk measure, then Fund B is much less risky than Fund A, whereas Fund C lies between.When assessing the positive and negative volatility of funds A, B and C, we have:Looking at the positive and negative volatility of each fund leads to a very different conclusion from just looking at their overall volatility: Fund C having the highest negative volatility and the lowest positive volatility is actually the riskiest of the three funds, whereas fund A having the highest positive volatility and the lowest negative volatility is the least risky, and fund B lies in between.In fact, by taking a closer look at the returns of the three funds, Fund A contained its losses as much as Fund B but was able to capitalize on three strong returns that Fund B couldn’t capture. On the other hand, Fund C is similar to Fund B but has only been heavily hit once, whereas Fund B hasn’t.Therefore, would one rather invest in a fund that delivers good returns, controlling the downside, but without any upswing either (Fund B), or invest in a fund that controls the downside as well, but which can deliver a winning lottery ticket from time to time (Fund A)?Assessing the volatility of a crypto fund with a nonlinear framework is the only way to assess its true risk from a volatility point of view — i.e., understanding what contributes to high volatility.Debunked myth #1: A crypto fund with overall high volatility doesn’t necessarily equate a highly risky one.Correlation measures how an asset is moving in relation to another one. The closer an asset is to 1, the more the assets will move in sync; the closer an asset is to -1, the more the assets will move in the opposite direction one from each other.Again, measuring the overall correlation of a nonlinear asset can lead to misleading conclusions about how one asset moves in comparison with another.Example:Fund A: { -9%; 13%; -1%; 15%; -9%; 1; 28%; -6%; -2%; 0% } Fund B: { 5%; 13%; 1%; 28%; 6%; 1; 25%; -5%; 2%; -1% }Benchmark: { -28%; 2%; -33%; 34%; -19%; -15; 21%; -10%; -6%; -5% }The correlation of Fund A to the benchmark is 0.81, which is similar to the correlation of Fund B to the benchmark. By looking at how these two funds correlate with their common benchmark, they are identical when assessing their overall correlation.Now assessing the positive and negative correlations of Funds A and B with their benchmark, we have: a more subtle manner to assess the correlation of a fund with a benchmark. It consists of breaking the global correlation measure described above into two sub-correlation analyses: The positive correlation is the measured correlation of the fund with a benchmark only during positive returns of the benchmark, whereas the negative correlation is the measured correlation of the fund with a benchmark only during negative returns of the benchmark. The positive and negative correlation measures range like the standard correlation measure between -1 and +1 with the same meaning.Therefore, an investor should look for a fund that has a high positive (i.e., the closest to +1) positive-correlation, meaning the fund moves up when the benchmark moves up, and a low negative (i.e., the closest to -1) negative-correlation, meaning that the fund moves up when the benchmark moves down.Fund A exhibits a moderate positive positive-correlation with its benchmark (0.23) and a moderate positive negative-correlation with its benchmark (0.30), whereas Fund B shows a very high positive positive-correlation with the benchmark (0.97) and a medium negative negative-correlation with its benchmark (-0.45).This means that Fund A moved more or less in sync with its benchmark either on the upside or the downside, whereas Fund B moved upward when the benchmark was up most of the time but moved also upward from time to time when the benchmark was moving down. This is exactly the characteristic of a fund investors should look for, but this is only visible in a nonlinear framework.Debunked myth #2: A high global correlation of a crypto fund to a benchmark doesn’t necessarily mean that the fund will move in sync with the benchmark most of the time.The beta measures the amplitude of how an asset is moving compared to another. Its value is a rough estimate of how much an asset will move vs. another one considered. A value above 1 means that an asset moves more than 1x than another one in the same direction; a value between 0 and 1 means that an asset moves less than 1x than another one in the same direction. Negative values can be interpreted as positive values in terms of multiplying effect, but with moves on the opposite directions.Note: The beta of an asset vs. another should only be calculated if there’s a statistically significant correlation between the two assets.Example: Let’s consider the two funds used previously with the correlation analysis, which were both highly correlated with the benchmark (0.81).Fund A: {-9%; 13%; -1%; 15%; -9%; 1; 28%; -6%; -2%; 0%}Fund B: {5%; 13%; 1%; 28%; 6%; 1; 25%; -5%; 2%; -1%}Benchmark: {-28%; 2%; -33%; 34%; -19%; -15; 21%; -10%; -6%; -5%}The beta of Fund A to the benchmark is 0.46, and the beta of Fund B to the benchmark 0.43 — i.e., both funds have a similar beta to their benchmark. But are they really equal?Assessing the positive and negative beta of Funds A and B with their benchmark, we have: Unsurprisingly, when looking at the beta of these two funds through a nonlinear prism, we have a different story. Fund A tends to capture on average about 11% of an up or down move of its benchmark, whereas Fund B tends to capture on average 48% of an up move of its benchmark while capturing -15% of a negative move of its benchmark — i.e., capturing 15% of the amplitude of the down move of its benchmark, but delivering it in positive terms instead.Just like with the correlation, investors should seek to invest with funds showing an as-high-as-possible positive positive-beta and an as-high-as-possible negative negative-beta vs. the funds’ benchmarks. Debunked myth #3: The overall beta of a crypto fund has no value unless it is assessed in a nonlinear manner.The value at risk, or VaR, is an estimate of how much an investment might lose, with a given probability, given normal market conditions, and in a set time period.Example: VaR (Fund, 95%) = -7.5% means that over the considered period, the fund can lose more than -7.5% with 5% (= 100%–95%) probability. In other words, there’s a 95% chance that the fund will lose less than -7.5% over the considered period.There are many ways to compute the VaR of an asset that go beyond the scope of this paper, but again, if the nonlinear behavior of the asset is not taken into account in estimating the VaR, the results lead to false conclusions.However, given the often-hectic behavior of digital assets, it is difficult to assess their VaR, no matter the model used, and the obtained results may not be of great help to calibrate risk. This is why VaR is not really used to assess crypto funds. Now that the main die-hard myths about fund metric analysis have been debunked, another misleading analysis aspect of crypto funds is to compare the metrics side by side with the well-known metrics of traditional assets.Essentially, digital assets are way more volatile than their traditional cousins, and some of their metrics can be of several orders of magnitude different: from annualized return and volatility to the Sharpe and Sortino ratios.For example, a Sharpe ratio above 1 is more of an exception rather than the norm for funds dealing with traditional assets, as their annualized return is usually in the 5%–15% range and an annualized volatility of 10%–15% that doesn’t imply insignificant returns from their means. However, with Bitcoin (BTC), for example, its annualized return from 2016 to date has been slightly above 100%, while its annualized volatility is close to 85%, leading to a ratio above 1 despite its frequent booms and busts.Thus, the Sharpe ratio of a good crypto fund — one that is able to provide to capture most of the upside of its underlying asset while protecting on the downside — can be in a high single to a low double-digit range, which can appear highly suspicious if compared to the Sharpe ratio of a typical hedge fund.The same is even more true for the Sortino ratio. For example, Bitcoin has a 30% annualized downside volatility, which is roughly three times that of the S&P 500, meaning negative returns reaching three times further than the ones of the S&P 500, which leads to a three times lower value of the denominator of the Sortino ratio of Bitcoin. However, if Bitcoin has an annualized return 10 times bigger than that of the S&P 500, the numerator of the Sortino ratio of Bitcoin will be 10 times higher than the numerator of the Sortino ratio of the S&P 500. Thus, when calculating the Sortino ratio of Bitcoin, dividing a numerator that is 10 times bigger (than the one of the S&P 500) by a denominator that is 3 times bigger (than the one of the S&P 500), we obtain roughly a ratio for Bitcoin that is about 3.3 (=10/3) times higher than that of the S&P 500. More precisely, the Sortino ratio of Bitcoin is above three, whereas the Sortino ratio of the S&P 500 is about 0.8.Therefore, for a good crypto fund, posting a high annualized return over limited downside volatility can easily lead to a high double-digit Sortino ratio.Drawdowns are bounded metrics between 0% and -100%, contrary to the unbounded metrics that are the Sharpe and Sortino ratios described above. Thus, an investor can compare side by side the drawdowns of a crypto fund to the ones of a traditional fund without having to take into account the scaling of the metrics.However, investors have to understand that the magnitude of drawdowns of crypto funds can be more substantial than the ones of a fund trading only traditional assets, as the digital assets can swing more wildly. For example, a 40% drawdown for a crypto fund can be “equivalent” to a 15% drawdown for a traditional fund, but the crypto fund lost is nevertheless more than the traditional fund. The idea is just to put things into perspective here.A loss due to a drawdown is never pleasant to experience, especially when it is a big loss; therefore, investors have to pay more attention to the shapes of the fund drawdowns. The shape of a drawdown refers to the shape described by the drawdown curve of a fund. These shapes are triangles more or less tilted, which tell how the fund manager dealt with losses and are highly instructive, as we will detail below.Let’s consider these three funds:Fund A: { 1%; 3%; -1%; 5%; 2%; -23.5; 2%; 6%; -2%; 3%; 1%; 5%; 2%; -3%; 6%; 3% }Fund B: { 1%; -2%; -1%; -0.5%; -2%; -1.5%; -2%; 0.5%; -2%; -3%; -1%; -2%; -1%; 23%; -1%; 2% }Fund C: { 2%; -1%; 3%; 1%; -0.5%; 1%; -0.5%; -19%; 21%; -3%; 2%; 1%; -0.5%; 2%; 0%; 1% }They all have the same performance (around +5%) and maximum drawdown (around -20%) over the same period, but the shapes of their drawdowns depict a very different story for each fund.Generally, there are three cases:1. A sudden loss followed by a steady recovery over several weeks. This is the shape of the drawdowns one could expect. At some point, the fund manager’s strategy is caught wrong-footed and a sudden, steep loss occurs. As discussed earlier, as the old Wall Street adage says “markets take the elevator down, but the stairs up” — i.e., a sudden panic move downward happens quickly, but it takes time for the markets to calm down and realize that what caused the panic move in the first place is over, which explains the slow recovery. These drawdowns are normal and inherent to the strategy. Investors have to simply make sure that all of the past major drawdowns were about the same magnitude, showing the robustness of the underlying strategy; bad trades occur, but they are always controlled and will eventually recover.2. Continuous and increasing losses over several months recovered in just a few weeks. Such drawdowns are more problematic, as they may show that the manager’s strategy hasn’t worked for a long time, but facing investors’ redemptions, the fund manager went “all in” in order to stop the bleeding: It’s make or break. However, such drawdown shapes can sometimes also be explained by the way the strategy works and may not be a sign of a gambling fund manager. This is why it is always important to understand what the fund strategy tends to capture in order to assess its behavior.3. A sudden loss, followed by a quick recovery. These drawdowns can take place from time to time and are usually linked to a market dislocation, leading to a fast and deep loss followed by an equally strong recovery.Finally, when looking at fund drawdowns, having data-sampling as precise as possible is key: Looking at drawdowns on a daily basis or on a monthly basis can lead to very different conclusions.If managers just report their performance on a monthly basis, as is generally the case, only the change of the fund’s net asset value, or NAV, between the last day of the current month and the last day of the previous month are disclosed. There’s no information about what occurred during the month. For performance-reporting purposes, that’s fine, but for risk assessment, this can be highly misleading.Indeed, if the fund witnessed a 30% drawdown during the month that fully recovered by the end of the month, then looking only at monthly NAVs won’t show it, and investors will have a false sense of confidence by assuming that the fund never had any 30% drawdown in this example. Reporting performance on a daily basis shows what happened from day to day, which is far more informative than just from month to month.For passive index, drawdowns measured on a daily or monthly basis are very close because there’s no active management involved. However, with actively traded strategies, short but steep drawdowns can occur from time to time, and if investors are not aware of that possibility, they may be in for a rude awakening, possibly panicking and selling their holdings. Crypto funds come in different shapes and sizes, as we have briefly described in this article.No matter their nature, since they are all dealing with highly volatile underlying assets, they tend to exhibit nonlinear behavior, which requires a proper framework to analyze them. Through a nonlinear analysis of such funds, we have highlighted that:Another point we touched upon is that comparing metrics of traditional funds vs. crypto funds is like comparing apples to oranges, given the very different nature of the underlying instruments traded.We concluded on the drawdowns of crypto funds, which, to us, are a very powerful risk metric when properly analyzed. If an investor had to look at just one risk metric to assess the risk taken vs. the delivered performance, it would be the fund drawdowns, not just their depth, but also their shapes.We gave some directions on which metrics to look at and analyze, but metrics without their context are meaningless. This is why such an analysis should always be conducted under the supervision of the professional fund manager’s explanations about his strategy.This is part two of a two-part series on how to sort crypto funds — read part one with an overview of the main types of crypto funds here.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

55,"Miner profitability metrics are based on a handful of factors regulating difficulty and emission, which are hard-coded into the blockchain’s attributes, making it predictable to work with. While predictability does not always immediately translate into profitability, it gives a blockchain certain parameters to rely on when predicting when mining cryptocurrency will become profitable, at which price level, and at which difficulty level during the emission cycle.Some cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), go through emission cycles with events such as the halving. In Bitcoin’s case, halvings occur once every 210,000 blocks — roughly every four years — until the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin has been mined. This feature, self-adjusting difficulty, provides an incentive for an individual miner to join or leave the network depending on the current Bitcoin price level. Together, these incentives create a logarithmic price regression curve, which represents a probable Bitcoin exchange rate and, therefore, predictability of profitability in the current emission cycle. If Bitcoin’s price falls under this regression curve where the bottom line is roughly around the 200-week moving average in this emission cycle, nearly all of the miners should be at a net loss. If the price stays above this figure, at least some of the miners should be at a net profit.Bitcoin mining difficulty is currently at an all-time high between 110 and 120 million terahashes per second, indicating that a lot of new mining capacity has been added to the network, but since the price hasn’t fully recovered from the dip caused by the emergence of COVID-19, we should expect most of the miners being temporarily at a loss. However, should Bitcoin’s price rise back up again into the current emission cycle and go into a bull run, the economic risk miners would have taken at that point should be greatly rewarded.Ethereum mining has been, for a while, among the most profitable in the altcoin space primarily because of the high average price of its token. However, Ethereum as a network has a primary focus on building a blockchain with a slightly different purpose compared to Bitcoin. Ethereum is a smart contract platform. While mining has previously supported the network in the phase where it isn’t widely used for transactions, in the future, the network will be compelled to take on staking nodes as validators in order to provide sufficient transaction capacity. In the long run, this may have a positive effect on mining if we assume that mining will be phased out gradually. A substantial amount of coins are predicted to be locked in staking, which is going to drive up the price.Staking is a mechanism that allows users to deposit some of their coins into a staking address owned by a validator node and locks them for a period of time. The validator node then secures the network by producing blocks relative to the number of coins deposited in it. The blocks are produced according to a hard-coded voting mechanism that calculates the staking reward from the total amount of coins staked in the network for each node.Related: ETH Miners Will Have Little Choice Once Ethereum 2.0 Launches With PoSThe price of electricity is a defining factor in miner profitability. Currently, most industrial miners reside in countries with cheap electricity on power purchasing agreements with electricity producers ranging from hydropower to solar. However, most retail miners mostly depend on retail price fluctuations and have to calculate this factor into their investments. Moreover, the price of electricity isn’t a factor when mining profitable altcoins with GPU rigs.Equipment prices tend to fluctuate according to price cycles. At the bottom of each cycle, buying equipment is relatively affordable, but toward each cycle peak, equipment may not be affordable but also unavailable. At this point, it would likely be profitable to take a moderate risk in mining, especially in GPU mining. Regarding profitability alone, mining Bitcoin would probably require an investment beyond the reach of most retail miners on the initial cost to be remarkable at the peak of this emission cycle.Apart from only turning a profit, mining is a way to produce coins with no prior history. For users who care about their privacy, mining represents economic freedom, making a means of payment with no ties to a specific entity accessible. This unique feature is only present in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies and connects many people on the fringes of society with often legitimate use cases to the wider world, acting as a guarantor of human and social rights.For some organizations, maintaining a blockchain at a nominal loss can act as an investment either by supporting profitable services or by maintaining infrastructure to run services for public use. In legacy systems, this type of arrangement is comparable to public service, or a utility.While utility provision can be an advantage for a network of entities running on a permissioned blockchain or a PoW blockchain intended for a well-defined use, on open public blockchains, in the long run, miners can be assumed to operate on a profit motive. With difficulty adjustments and profitability in public blockchains with significant utility value such as Bitcoin, mining can be seen as a profitable business in the foreseeable future.The only credible factor that may upset the status quo in mining PoW cryptocurrencies at the moment seems to be the theoretical introduction of widespread quantum computing with enough accessible tools to create an incentive to attack public blockchains. However, this kind of risk can be exaggerated because quantum computing proof algorithms exist and are likely to be developed precisely to mitigate a risk arising from this quite predictable factor.In this light, mining will probably not become profitable in the upcoming bull market, but more relevant in ways that are not only economically.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

56,"A pilot project run by Bitbeat-affiliate company CIC Enterprise wants to provide crypto payment solutions at two of the busiest beaches of the country for tourists to use.According to ZDNet Korea, the firm partnered with card and cash payments provider Innotech for the token-powered payments solution in the Haeundae Beach System on the beaches of Busan in South Korea famous with tourists.The program will allow people to pay for water sports-related activities, life jackets, and even parasol rentals, among others, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), along with MCI and WAY ERC20 tokens through a smartphone-based application.Bitbeat said that such payments could be processed in less than 10 seconds by relying on the use of QR codes for any wallet in the world, making it different from similar projects that often require customers to download separate apps to complete all the process.The company adds:“We hope that the virtual currency used in the Haeundae-gu beach system will be more widely used in real life. We will try to provide a cryptocurrency payment environment.”Busan authorities expect that on summer days, people will prefer to rent services within the Haeundae beaches, instead of bringing their own things to enjoy the time spent on the beaches. Another beach in Songjeong is also running a similar crypto pay pilot.Also, in Busan, a private-public consortium in South Korea announced on June 20 their intention to build a blockchain-powered medical tourism platform. A launch date has not bet set, and according to Gyeongnam Ilbo, the initiative will be led by Busan Bank."
57,"Another good week for Bitcoin last week. The dollar price rose more than 5 percent, taking it to around $11,700. That rise wasn’t smooth. A flash crash took $1,500 off the price at one point, although investors remain bullish and the VIX volatility index, which is based on the S&P 500, is “extremely bullish.” Other volatility measures, though, suggest another drop to $10,000 before a new rally, while the Winklevoss twins think that the amount of infrastructure and capital in the crypto markets will make this bull run very different from the 2017 run.It’s not just Bitcoin that’s been on a run, though. Ethereum has hit a two-year high of $400, supported by decentralized finance protocols, the anticipated arrival of ETH 2.0, and the general rise in the altcoin market.Meanwhile, in the analog world, the US printed more money in June than it did in the first two centuries after its founding.Where there are riches, there are also thieves, and hackers have broken into a cryptocurrency trading platform in Europe. The thieves stole more than $1.3 million from 2gether. The platform has offered customers its own 2GT token as a replacement. Bitfinex is still trying to track down hackers who stole more than 120,000 Bitcoins back in August 2016. The exchange is offering a reward of up to $400 million and is even willing to give the hackers 25 percent of the total property recovered.As for that big Twitter hack that saw accounts as large as Elon Musk’s, Joe Biden’s and Bill Gates’s ask for Bitcoins, authorities have now arrested a 17-year-old in Tampa, Florida. He has been something of a trend-setter, though. Hackers have been taking over big YouTube channels, changing their names to topics like SpaceX and Elon Musk, and offering similar Bitcoin giveaways. The hackers appear to be using phishing attacks targeting the owners of large channels.Not all law evasion is bad though. Chinese Internet users have turned to the blockchain to share a censored news article. The article is about a company that gave faulty vaccines to babies.

58,"Crypto cards have become a must-have for many crypto services. Hoping to reduce the risk of blocking transactions, companies have been looking again and again for reason why their customers should use “plastic.” But a crypto card is a placebo that does not solve the problems of either users or fintech companies — its only goal is to bring profit to payment systems and intermediaries.Crypto cards are not needed in the same way that special financial instruments are not needed to buy gold, oil, precious metals or any other resource. The word “cryptocurrency” — like “dollar” or “euro” — indicates only the currency for transactions with which the card can be used and does not make the banking product any more innovative. However, until banks and payment systems recognize this, we will be forced to eliminate the consequences of cooperation with Wirecard, WaveCrest and other processors that aren’t the most conscientious, wanting to make money by taking risks but without being able to manage them.Bank card technologies have gone through a rapid evolutionary path in a very short period of time. They are the fundamental and connecting element for all retail trade relationships. According to Nilson Report, there are currently more than 22 billion payment cards in circulation around the world — debit, credit and prepaid. Taking into account that 1.7 billion people do not use banking services at all, for each of the remaining 6 billion people, there are on average 3.6 cards.All cards are serviced by payment systems that create a closed consumption ecosystem. Here’s what happens:Banks and processor companies pay Visa, Mastercard, UnionPay, American Express and other international payment systems for the possibility of issuing cards.Cardholders pay banks an annual fee or transaction fees.Sellers transfer to banks on average 1%–4% of the transaction amount for acquiring servicing.Various intermediaries, aggregators, API providers, etc. also collect a commission.The main thing is that in each commission payment between all participants, a share of Visa, Mastercard or another payment system is included. If we are talking about cryptocurrency transactions, then the commission of payment systems will be higher, since the traditional financial industry regards these transactions as high-risk.And yet, bank cards are almost indispensable for transactions worth up to $5,000. This is the fastest and most convenient way to buy crypto from numerous wallets and/or exchanges. Therefore, it would be naive to think that fintech companies could quickly get rid of the intermediation of payment systems and stop paying them for every transaction.Nevertheless, Visa and Mastercard can do a lot to make their native cards much friendlier to crypto and become a part of the solution, not part of the problem, which Wirecard has been trying to get around, making this kind of change seem inevitable.Today, when the volume of non-cash payments in many countries has surpassed cash payments, any company wanting to issue bank cards under its own brand, in theory, has three options.1. Become a principal (direct) participant in the international system. To do this, you need to meet a number of mandatory criteria: have the necessary technological platform and qualified personnel, meet information security requirements, provide security funds, etc.For example, last year, a principal Visa participant had to have capital of at least $56 million directly with the Visa payment system. Therefore, you need to have an account in United States dollars in the U.S. or in euro in the European Union. The licensing procedure itself can cost about $1 million, excluding the funds required for the security deposit and direct royalties. This is not a realistic option for small and medium fintech companies.2. Become an associated member of the payment system through the sponsoring bank. In this case, it is the bank that takes care of the compliance with the payment system requirements. The license fee is $200,000–$300,000, plus a deposit of several million dollars.However, even under such conditions, financial organizations do not want to directly cooperate with crypto companies since transactions with cryptocurrency are classified by payment systems as high-risk due to the lack of a unified approach to regulating this area. This results in higher fees and chargebacks for transactions that have been challenged by the cardholder.3. Contact a processing company. Unlike banks, processors are responsible for issuing payment cards. Among such processors, crypto services usually find partners with a high-risk appetite that are willing to cooperate. Such companies are ready to use various tricks so that payments passing through them are not blocked by the payment system. For example:Conceal or falsify before the payment system the main activity of the company for which the issue occurs.Use incorrect Merchant Category Codes.Issue crypto cards on their own Bank Identification Number, while according to the rules of payment systems, a separate BIN must be allocated for each individual product.Issue co-branded cryptocurrency cards, which are, in fact, bank cards “with an individual design” and are then sold through a crypto service.Expand the limits of card transactions, regardless of the requirements of payment systems and/or the regulator, etc.All of these are often unjustified risks that processors like Wirecard take on, increasing the cost of issuing and maintaining crypto cards for both crypto services and end-users. Meanwhile, the value of these crypto cards continues to depreciate.Until recently, people were forced to buy a fourth or even fifth payment card, only for the sake of the “crypto” prefix in order to save their money from being blocked during operations with cryptocurrency. However, regulated crypto services have already learned to tackle this problem differently — by acting strictly within the framework of compliance requirements and forging links with traditional financial institutions.High-risk processors like Wirecard or Wavecrest can be compared to microfinance institutions, or MFIs, that lend out at huge interest rates. Usually, people turn to MFIs after numerous — and not always objective — refusals by banks to issue a loan. Sometimes, the money is needed urgently, and the consideration of the application in the bank is delayed; sometimes the bank’s scoring system does not like the place of work, marital status or the gender of a person. There may be many reasons, but the result is the same: The bank does not want to take risks and people go to less discerning financial intermediaries. Crypto services are forced to do this, too.A cryptocurrency card is a ridiculous, temporary and forced necessity because banks and payment systems do not want to manage risks on their own. All the risks that Wirecard once assumed when working with crypto companies are now easily eliminated. Licensing of activities in the field of cryptocurrencies, the implementation of KYC/AML procedures, obtaining a compliance certificate of the payment card industry data security standards and other measures allow crypto services to successfully work with the traditional financial system.Banks should have the courage to start making money by partnering with regulated crypto services. And for this, above all else, it is necessary to develop internal expertise in the field of compliance. As bank employees have had little motivation to deal with the peculiarities of high-risk transactions, it is easier for them to refuse service to potential clients and/or stop transactions.However, if a bank’s compliance service monitors and skips high-risk transactions on a regular and systematic basis, this will create additional cash flow, from which banks could also receive commissions. I am sure that cryptocurrency users’ right to dispose of honestly received assets should be ensured in an absolutely transparent, legal way, and not by gray schemes. Any card can be crypto, and this is the reality we should all be living in — sooner rather than later.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Alex Axelrod is the founder and CEO of Aximetria and Pay Reverse.

59,"The crypto options market has been evolving rapidly over the second quarter of 2020. According to TokenInsight’s recent crypto derivatives industry report, trading volumes are seeing a 166% year-on-year increase compared to Q2 2019. The derivative products driving these volumes are futures and options. While futures grow with traders betting on a bullish price sentiment, both open interest and volumes of options have reached all-time highs.On Wednesday, open interest in Ether (ETH) options hit an all-time high of $351 million on Deribit and $37 million on OKEx. In fact, open interest in Ether options is 2.5 times higher than it was at the start of July.A day prior to the major Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry event seen on July 3, Bitcoin options interest hit an all-time high of $1.7 million on Deribit and $268 million on CME, while daily volumes on Deribit doubled their all-time high, surpassing 47,500 contracts traded on July 28. This all-time high seen the day before its expiration on the last Friday of the month could often mean the increasing acceptance of options and structured products, especially considering the record OI’s hit even on CME, which is the largest derivatives exchange in the world.Luuk Strijers, the chief commercial officer of Deribit, spoke of OI being the best indicator to gauge the market, telling Cointelegraph: “Open interest is the best indicator to assess market adoption, and looking at the charts, it is apparent we are close to the end of July highs.” He added: “BTC options open interest is currently 116K contracts with a notional value of USD 1.5 billion.”Options are financial instruments that allow investors to buy or sell an underlying asset depending on the type of contract they hold. Call options give holders the right to buy an asset at the strike price within a certain timeframe, while put options give holders the right to sell an asset in similar conditions. Denis Vinokourov, the head of research at BeQuant — a crypto exchange and institutional brokerage provider — told Cointelegraph:“Options are a very efficient way to hedge exposure to the underlying product, be that Bitcoin or Ethereum spot or even futures/perpetuals. In addition to that, it is easier to structure products that would offer ‘yield,’ and it is this that has been particularly appealing to market participants, especially in the wake of sideways market price action.”Lennix Lai, the director of financial markets at OKEx crypto exchange, told Cointelegraph that traders should be wary, as “high OIs alone do not indicate the market is bullish or bearish,” further adding that investors incline toward long strategies: “We have recognized that there are a lot more professionals who are leveraging options for hedging their long-only BTC portfolio. And there are lots of more structured products available in the market tailored to professionals for the sake of yield enhancement or exotic payoff.”With Bitcoin price briefly surpassing the $11,900 mark several times earlier this month, the general interest in cryptocurrencies has been on the rise. Bitcoin has rallied 27% since July 1, which is the highest spike seen in 2020. Bitcoin options are currently trading mainly on Deribit, CME, OKEx and LedgerX, while Bakkt, a crypto exchange owned by major traditional exchange Intercontinental Exchange, sees zero options volumes despite having the product listed. Additionally, the put-call ratio has increased from 0.52 month over month to 0.76 on Aug. 6, which means that a greater proportion of put options were sold as compared to call options. This is a strong indicator of the bullish sentiment that investors currently hold. Lai added to this notion:“Looking at the growing demand for Bitcoin options, OI and volume, it would seem to suggest that investors are still bullish on Bitcoin price, and with the greater macro factors such as the drop in the U.S. dollar price and an all-time high in gold, the demand for Bitcoin, in general, is rising.”More investors seem to be acquiring ETH exposure using options in 2020. Ether, being the runner up to Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency space, has become one of the main experimental labs for blockchain scalability backed by large institutional and entrepreneurial development communities. Therefore, it’s natural for ETH to become a speculative asset as more decentralized applications are developed. Related: Ethereum 2.0 Staking, ExplainedThe upcoming Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake shift for Ethereum and the rapid growth of the DeFi space have proved to be big variables driving the bullish sentiment while adding more credibility to the network. Seeing that Ether options are mainly traded by retail investors, at this point, as they are not traded in regulated exchanges like CME and Bakkt just yet, the growth is further testament of the community’s interest. Strijers elaborated more on the statistics of Ether options and futures traded on Deribit saying:“The number of use cases for ETH keeps growing, and investors buy into this potential. Deribit ETH options open interest has grown 7x from USD 30–50 million six months ago to USD 350 million now which represents a 90% market share. And while ETH spot prices are peaking, the same applies to ETH futures open interest, which is almost reaching USD 1.5 billion, a new all-time high.”Posting monthly gains of over 60% and YTD gains surpassing 200%, ETH broke the $400 price mark at the start of August. The impact of the release of Ethereum 2.0’s final PoS testnet “Medalla” and the implications it will have on the DeFi space are now being taken in by the market. Institutional interest has also appeared in the news — like Arca Labs launching an Ethereum-based fund registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. While Deribit currently occupies the largest market share of the options space, there are new players who have been trying to capitalize on this surge in investor interest. While Strijers welcomed more competition in the space since it would help the pie to grow, there may be certain complexities involved, according to Lai:“One of the prerequisites of a liquid options market is an equally or even more liquid futures market. Not to mention the complexity of handling the liquidation, mark price and margining, which is far more complicated than delta product-like futures.”Vinokourov furthered this perspective by comparing the differences in running a crypto derivatives exchange to a spot exchange. He revealed that the main challenges surround maintaining a liquid order book “across a variety of expiries and strike prices, with a matching engine robust enough to withstand sudden bursts of volatility,” in addition to an institutional-grade system to manage risks. He further opined:“If all that wasn’t enough, client acquisition is that much more difficult than spot equivalent because there are fewer firms that trade these products, and they require institutional-grade client management — something that crypto exchanges are not always able to offer.”Irrespective of how the options pie is split, arguably, it’s only set to grow even further in size, especially through exchanges like CME now becoming a more prominent player in the space. The bullish sentiment of BTC and ETH will serve to support this growth further by allowing investors more opportunities to speculate."
60,"All the speculative capital invested in Bitcoin (BTC) at the moment totals just a few billion dollars shy of Bank of America's market valuation.Bitcoin's current market cap sits just over $217 billion, according to Cointelegraph data at press time, while Yahoo Finance shows Bank of America's market cap holding slightly over $226 billion — a comparison introduced in a recent article from The Next Web. Although it has endured its fair share of dramatic price fluctuations, Bitcoin's price has grown substantially in 2020, rising past several different wealth comparisons along the way.Back in March, just before COVID-19 measures turned the world on its head, the United States Central Bank pumped the economy with $168 billion in capital. At the time, Bitcoin's market cap held near $145 billion. In April, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' touted a net worth of approximately $140 billion, with Bitcoin's market cap near $130 billion. On paper, it seemed Bezos could have bought all the Bitcoin in circulation with a few billion to spare, although the mass purchase would likely prove impossible in real life due to factors such as rising prices and liquidity. Since then, Bezos' net worth has reached a staggering $193 billion. Bitcoin's valuation, however, remains higher near $217 billion. In an Aug. 4 crossover podcast episode with Peter McCormack, host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano recently forecasted a future Bitcoin market cap of more than $80 or $90 trillion at some point before the end of time. Pompliano, however, said he was unsure if Bitcoin would reach such a market cap within his lifetime.  A long-time Bitcoin advocate, Pompliano has stated his position many times on Bitcoin as an asset uncorrelated with mainstream markets.  "
61,"The advantage of the cross-blockchain protocol for public registries is that it can unite any number of existing ledgers in one ecosystem and does not need to upgrade the protocols of such blockchains. In simple terms, the protocol works as an aggregator of tokens across blockchains. The protocol conceptually comprises two major elements:The resulting representation of the collected tokens is a logical superstructure across many blockchains — the public registry. It is decentralized because the same algorithms are applied to every node independently. So, a government agency, for example, doesn’t exclusively own one public property database, but it literally lives on every user’s machine in the cross-blockchain database.As we discussed the level of the protocol in Part 2, we have a component of governance to address legal issues and enforce lawful decisions. The subsystem works as a set of patches and filters for users’ records. Even though formally compliant with the format, the user’s record can be filtered out as the jurisdiction recognizes it illegal or void.The public registry built on the cross-blockchain protocol aligns with three fundamental principles for decentralization:It is clear that governments will not allow anonymous transactions with immovable properties while we live in a world full of terrorist threats, problems of money laundering and blockchains that can potentially veil such activities.To address these, there must be verified digital identities, but without exposing personal data on-chain at the same time. And the answer to that is the combination of old and new technologies. The technology of public key infrastructure, or PKI, has existed for decades. Countries of the European Union are an example of the mass adoption of PKI through their legislative framework of eIDAS regulation. Estonia, for instance, offers the Estonian e-Residency, which is a smart card with a private key inside the chip.In PKI, users create an asymmetric pair of private and public keys. The private key is used to encrypt transactions, creating a so-called digital signature. The public decrypts the signature and verifies the transaction if it is signed with the corresponding private key. To maintain the validity of the public key, the user will ask a certificate authority to create a publicly available certificate where it includes the user’s public key.PKI is a centralized system that is prone to various vulnerabilities. We cannot eliminate a trusted third party to verify our identities, but we can address several types of attacks on the centralized PKI infrastructure. Blockchain technology is the perfect solution to develop a new generation of PKIs. Think about public certificates as tokens. Similar to creating tokens (certificates) of property, we can also create tokens to certify our identity. If you lose your private key, you will need to contact your certificate authority and ask to update its token of your identitiy (certificate) as invalid.There is no need to publish any personal data on-chain, instead only a cryptographic representation, which links to the personal data without exposing it.To reduce the risks of leaks of personal data from centralized servers, we should use self-sovereign identities. For example, a selective disclosure protocol can be applied to store personal data on a user’s device, a smartphone, and reveal transaction details in a limited manner.Digital identity is a separate topic that requires a lot of attention, and it was elaborated in relation to the recent Twitter hack, Europe’s experience with e-signatures and blockchain’s ability to prevent data leaks.Having all these technologies and concepts in mind, we see a larger picture. Credible public blockchains provide immutable ledgers, which, contrary to traditionally state-owned property registries, enable users to perform peer-to-peer transactions. However, blockchains do not require any public agency to maintain the infrastructure, as public ledgers are self-governed. Title tokens are records that represent legal rights. They are validated on-chain by those whom we trust and delegate this right. Trusted third parties are needed not only because a person cannot certify their birth and death, for example, to enable inheritance procedure but for any legal issues and law enforcement that inevitably arise. Through third parties and the cross-blockchain protocol, we can create an ecosystem of blockchains where users create and certify all sorts of rights, facts and digital identities.This concept is better than the current centralized systems, as it runs through the framework of smart laws and digital authorities, and they are the digital form (filters and patches) with the rooted records of addresses belonging to representatives whom people delegate the mandate of power for legal governance. Contrary to the centralized system, ledgers require everything to be recorded on-chain publicly to take effect, and they do not alter recorded transactions. So, on-chain governance is transparent and accountable.This concept cannot be implemented overnight, but its advantage is that it can be piloted step-by-step and run parallel to the existing system of public registries. The shift will happen when the government that wants to benefit from innovations recognizes the right of citizens to choose between a traditional registry and a blockchain, and it is a fundamental right for the decentralization of governance.This is part three of a three-part series on the theory of title token — read part one on the blockchain estate registry here, and part two on cross-blockchain protocol and smart laws here.

63,"Adam Back recently took to Twitter with controversial comments on many of the industry’s largest crypto projects — including Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), and Stellar (XML). His tweets placed these projects in the same category as a number of bonafide scams, which he considers to have been orchestrated as “premines”.We interviewed Back in order to clarify his position on the matter, starting with questions of how he feels about Satoshi Nakamoto essentially premining over one million Bitcoin. Back responded that “Bitcoin has no premine”, adding that he considers Patoshi research to be “highly speculative”. However, he agreed that Satoshi was able to amass a large amount of Bitcoin in the early days when the mining difficulty was low:“Yes I am agreeing with you. Even in the first year of bitcoin there would have been about 2.6 million coins mined at 50btc/block. So likely > 80% are other miners, clearly there were many 2009 miners.”Yet, he still believes there is a difference between mining coins at a very low cost and premining. In the case of most ICOs, he noted that “it was unknown that bitcoin would bootstrap and have value. It didn't even have an exchange listing for over a year.” Though the same could be said about many ICO coins, Back parried by focusing on what he perceives as the unscrupulous nature of ICOs. In his opinion, the main goal of an ICO is to enrich its creators — Something he believes most would consider unethical.Back also noted that ICOs offer investors far less in the way of legal protection. He elaborated:“There are no investor rights, no financial oversight so I don't think you can really assert what the money is spent on. Given the temptation and presumed motivation it is likely that most is lost to grift and personal enrichment of founders, promoters etc., when the money is used up they move onto the next coin.”We asked Back if he earnestly believes that no major ICO project will ever deliver anything of note. With some hesitation, he admitted that a few may have funded useful research. He still believes that it is highly inefficient to utilize funds in this manner overall. He said:“Obviously there are exemptions, and some interesting ICO or pre-mined altcoins funded research, or grants to skilled researchers, but the efficiency of capital I think is order of 100x less effective in converting money to secure, robust protocols than lean startups.”The Hashcash creator believes that most of the top projects by market capitalization are nothing but high school projects “with a $billion marketing budget”:“I think we can presume that incentives matter, and so it is a variant of follow the money — if they have immediate liquidity and no oversight they overspend on marketing, price manipulation over engineering substance.”Back also supposed that ICO projects are left with second-rate engineers as most top blockchain developers “would not work for ICOs as a matter of principle”."

65,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $11,219 on Bitstamp on Aug.7 after the United States stock market declined. BTC recovered quickly from the brief crash, stabilizing at above $11,600.The price of Bitcoin drops steeply on Bitstamp. Source: TradingView.comThe release of new job data caused the U.S. stock market to slump in mid-day. Non-farm payrolls rose by 1.763 million in July, surpassing Wall Street expectations by 10.6%.Despite the optimistic job data, analysts are seemingly concerned that the job market is not growing fast enough. Since the pandemic began in March, the U.S. still has 13 million unemployed individuals.Over the past several months, the price of Bitcoin saw relatively volatile movements ahead of new job data. The volatility likely comes from the recent correlation between BTC and stocks.The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500. Source: SkewData from Skew shows that Bitcoin has shown some correlation with stocks since April. Since the stock market reacts strongly to unemployment data, BTC has typically followed the trend of stocks in the first week of the month.Strategists were skeptical of the new job data, factoring in the abrupt increase in part-time workers. Washington Center for Equitable Growth’s economist Kate Bahn said many of the newly added jobs would likely pay less. She said:""We added more jobs than most people expected, but the gains really were disproportionately part-time workers. To me that means even if workers are coming back it's to jobs that pay less, and families will be worse off.""The job data, which seemed positive on paper, eventually led the U.S. stock market to drop-off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined slightly by 0.28%, after a minor 0.6% drop the day before.As the U.S. stock market dipped, major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum’s Ether (ETH) saw a steep plunge. While BTC dropped to $11,219 on Bitstamp, Ether declined to around $371 across major exchanges.In the near term, there are several macro factors and geopolitical risks that could impact Bitcoin. First, U.S.–China relations are worsening over WeChat and TikTok bans. Second, the talks of a stimulus deal have slowed down.The tension between the two superpowers is seemingly ramping up after U.S. President Donald Trump issued executive orders to ban Tencent’s WeChat and ByteDance’s TikTok. The chances of countermeasures by China could increase, which might potentially affect stocks and, therefore, Bitcoin.Reports also say that the chances of a stimulus deal are dim after Republican and Democratic representatives clashed. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said:“I think there is a lot of issues we are close to a compromise position on, but I think there are a handful of very big issues that we are still very far apart. We’ll see. I think we always said our objective is to try to reach an overall understanding tomorrow. If the Democrats are willing to compromise and do something, I think we’ll get something done.”The confluence of a delayed stimulus deal and the intensifying tensions between the U.S. and China could place pressure on both stocks and Bitcoin in the short term."
66,"Crypto mining in Iran is set to become even bigger with the government giving the green light for power plants to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The news is the latest piece of positive development on the virtual currency mining front to come out of the country in the last year.Since legalizing crypto mining back in July 2019, Iranian authorities have sought to ensure market participants operate only after obtaining the required licenses. By allowing power plants to engage in cryptocurrency mining, Iran is joining other emerging hubs as the global “hash wars” gathers pace.Iran has seen an influx of miners because of its cheap electricity, catapulting the country to be one of the more significant crypto mining nations outside of China. Meanwhile, major market participants in North America are expanding their operations with multiple inventory acquisitions over the past few months.Iranian authorities have given the go-ahead for power plants to mine cryptocurrency. However, the authorization comes with a caveat, as power plant operators cannot use subsidized fuel. Thus, Iranian power plants looking to mine Bitcoin must obtain a license from the government and use the approved electricity tariffs determined by the authorities. Not allowing power plants to use subsidized fuel is a measure taken by the government to ensure that such activities do not negatively impact the supply of electricity to residents as well as other industrial sectors in the country. Babak Behboudi, co-founder of digital asset trading platform SynchroBit Hybrid Exchange, told Cointelegraph that this news marks another milestone for legalized crypto mining in Iran:“It’s a great achievement as it indicated the Iranian government has recognized the crypto mining industry as a fact! It means that cryptocurrency can be considered as a legal and regulated asset by which people can do something for their business and life.”Iranian authorities emphasizing licensed crypto mining is not a new development. Indeed, as of January, the country’s Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade has issued over 1,000 licenses for cryptocurrency mining. Before legalization, some miners moved their operations to mosques in order to enjoy free electricity, prompting a government crackdown due to spikes in energy consumption.A compromise was soon found, with the government allowing crypto mining and even incentivizing more participants to move their operations to the country with the promise of tax holidays. Iranian cryptocurrency miners that repatriate their foreign earnings to the country are eligible for certain tax exemptions. As part of the campaign to only allow licensed crypto mining, the government has also offered rewards for whistleblowers who expose illegal cryptocurrency mining activities, with bounties of about 100 million rials ($2,375).In May, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, called on officials at the Central Bank of Iran, Ministry of Energy, and Ministry of Communications and Information Technology to develop a comprehensive national strategy for crypto mining. The move signaled greater intent by the government to include cryptocurrency mining in its economic recovery plans. With the country facing hyperinflation and a struggling economy made even worse by the coronavirus outbreak, the Iranian government has been increasingly examining the merits of greater involvement in the country’s crypto industry.Along with Egypt, Kuwait and Myanmar, Iran has one of the lowest electricity rates in the world. Cheap electricity is often an incentive for miners with healthier bottom lines. Outside of China, Iran controls the fifth-largest share of global Bitcoin mining hash rate distribution. Indeed, Iran’s rise in crypto mining activities in 2019 led to a slight decline in clean-energy crypto mining.In the third edition of its biannual Bitcoin mining report back in June 2019, digital asset management firm CoinShares revealed that global renewable energy penetration in the industry stood at 74.1%. In its latest research findings published in December 2019, the proportion slightly decreased to 73%. Commenting on the possibility of Iran claiming an even larger share of the global Bitcoin mining market, Behboudi remarked that it’s too early to say for sure:“To become a mining hub, the mining industry of Iran needs to have the access to the latest mining technologies, especially the advanced machines, to improve the efficiency of energy consumption and increasing the ROI of the investors. Moreover, we need to see how the government wants to set the roadmap for this new industry. A key issue is how the government wants to allow foreign companies and investors to participate in the crypto mining industry of Iran.”Power plants in Iran engaging in crypto mining might increase the country’s Bitcoin mining footprint, resulting in a larger share of the global hash rate distribution. As of August 2019, Iran ranked ninth in the world in thermal power generation capacity, with a rapid increase of 9,000 megawatts happening over a six-year period.The news also comes as participants in other major crypto mining hubs appear to be upscaling their operations. Major North American miners like Bitfarms and Marathon have made sizable orders for mining rigs from major manufacturers like MicroBT and Bitmain in the past few months.These new inventories contain the latest iterations of mining hardware touted as being able to deliver far greater levels of productivity than the older generation of rigs. Highly efficient crypto mining is even more of a concern in the present climate, especially after the May Bitcoin block reward halving.In Kyrgyzstan, Bitcoin mining seems to be attracting government interest. Earlier in August, the country’s Ministry of Economy released for public discussion a draft plan to impose a tax rate of 15% on Bitcoin miners. The move is part of efforts by the government to stimulate economic recovery amid the current COVID-19 pandemic.For Bitcoin permabulls, countries such as Iran will look to compete with the United States in a hash war. According to crypto bull Max Keiser, this tussle will catapult Bitcoin to a market price of $500,000. The migration of hash power from “East to West” could cause a significant decrease in China’s Bitcoin mining hash rate dominance. Western miners moving away from Europe’s high operating costs could relocate to North America where the U.S. is emerging as a viable option due to developments in regulation by a number of states.For now, China still dominates the industry, controlling 65% of the hash rate. With the monsoon season underway in China, pundits expect miners to see even greater profitability as electricity becomes abundant.In 2020, the industry has been forced to weather multiple storms including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the supply of hardware to miners. Following the Bitcoin halving, the spot market price of BTC also failed to see any upward push, forcing smaller mining operations to shut down. Thomas Heller, global business director at Bitcoin mining pool operator F2Pool, revealed the effects of the halving to Cointelegraph:“Daily mining revenue has dropped from ~$0.16 per TH/s pre-halving to $0.07 in July and is now around $0.10. Profit margins are much thinner and many old-gen machines have turned off, with the exception of those taking advantage of cheap Hydro Season power prices in China.”Whit Gibbs, CEO of crypto mining firm Hashr8, echoed similar sentiments, telling Cointelegraph that the post-halving has been brutal: “Obviously anytime you halve the block reward you’re directly impacting a Miner’s bottom line.” He continued: “Add to that the fact that despite months of sideways price action there was also a steady increase in difficulty, it was not a nice few months for Bitcoin miners.” According to Heller, range-bound sideways accumulation also played a big part:“Due to the BTC price, there has been much less demand for new-gen machines compared to 12 months earlier. A few companies in the U.S. and abroad have made very large orders from MicroBT and Bitmain, however, we aren’t expecting huge increases in network hashrate due to the slowish sales.”"
67,"New on-chain data suggests that demand for Bitcoin (BTC) from new investors is growing. Specifically, the number of new BTC addresses is nearing 2017 levels when the price hit $20,000.Brock Connelly, the CEO of RoundBlock Capital, said:“Has anyone noticed, daily active addresses (Bitcoin) is back above June 2019 levels, and approaching high of 1.29mm in December 2017. BTC market feels much different now.”Various on-chain metrics hint at a continuation of the Bitcoin uptrend, despite the digital asset’s 28% increase in the past three weeks.After the Aug. 2 Bitcoin flash crash, both BTC and Ether (ETH) have steadily increased in price. At the time, more than $1 billion worth of futures liquidations in one hour sent the market plunging for a brief period of time.Since then, major cryptocurrencies have stabilized, seeing less volatile price movements. The stability of BTC and ETH could also indicate the start of an accumulation phase.While this week’s BTC price action has been strong, the digital asset has many technical reasons to see a rejection from the $11,700 to $12,000 range. Historically, $12,000 has served as a strong resistance level and every attempt to close a weekly candle above it in the last two years led to prolonged corrections.With that said, the price of Bitcoin is steadily increasing as metrics like new BTC addresses continue to rise. The data suggests that many investors appear to be gradually accumulating BTC.One possible reason behind the steady uptrend of Bitcoin in the past five days could be the profitability of addresses. According to IntoTheBlock, 93.76% of all Bitcoin addresses are now in profit. The researchers said:“The Bitcoin network has a total of 702.11 million addresses, from which 30.99 million currently have a balance in BTC. At the current price of $11,758.8, 93.76% of the addresses with a balance are currently profiting from their BTC positions.”Inflow and outflow of Bitcoin from wallets. Source: IntoTheBlockOn-chain analysts often measure the profitability of addresses by capturing the value of Bitcoin first moved by an address. While it can be inaccurate at times, it typically indicates when the address first bought BTC.When the majority of addresses are in profit, it reduces the need to sell BTC in the near-term. While an argument for a take-profit pullback could be made, the current stability of BTC suggests otherwise.In the short-term, the largest roadblock for Bitcoin is the $12,000 resistance level. In recent weeks, BTC has consolidated just below the level and it should be noted that consolidation near a near a key resistance area can be considered a sign of optimism.Technical analyst Edward Morra suggested that spot traders on Coinbase and Bitstamp are defending the $11,600 to $11,700 range. The abundance of buy orders in the support area could reduce the probability of a big pullback.BTC-USD buy orders on Coinbase.

68,"In the past couple of weeks, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has resurged after months of apparent monetary stagnation. Since July 23, the value of a single Bitcoin has risen by around 20%. Not only that, after trading sideways since its supply squeeze in early May, the premier currency broke through its all-important $10,000 psychological threshold, thus leading many casual investors to once again jump back on the crypto hype train.Bitcoin’s recent price hike has also resulted in a retail boom, with a whole host of trading platforms across the world reporting sky-high Bitcoin trading volumes. As a result of this bullish market activity, Joe DiPasquale, prominent crypto pundit and CEO of BitBull Capital, recently stated that this latest surge is once again building up an element of FOMO, or fear of missing out, among casual investors who believe they might be late to the crypto party.Echoing a somewhat similar sentiment, Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of The Tie — a provider of data aggregation tools — commented to Cointelegraph that historically speaking, volatility has driven significant new waves of interest and investors into Bitcoin, particularly with the most recent run from $9,000 to $12,000. Frank outlined that the 30-day average number of Twitter users discussing Bitcoin has spiked from 24,000 to 30,000 over the last two weeks, adding:“Bitcoin hit its highest daily tweet volume level since June 26th 2019 in the wake of the Twitter scam on July 16th. While it isn’t clear that the run-up had any correlation to the scam, we have seen in the past that, all else equal, the more users talking about Bitcoin the better the asset performs.”Denis Vinokourov, head of research at BeQuant, a crypto exchange and institutional brokerage service, told Cointelegraph that since volatility picked up, his firm has observed trade volumes jumping by about 40% from where daily summer averages were prior to this recent rally.Cointelegraph also discussed the recent market action with Adam Vettese, market analyst at cryptocurrency trading and investment platform eToro. He pointed out that since crypto prices began rallying at the end of July, the number of crypto positions being opened increased by 115% versus the previous fortnight. Over the same time period, trading volume in crypto instruments also increased by 162%. The number of Bitcoin positions opened increased by 222% with a 421% rise for Ether (ETH) and 170% for XRP.Christophe Michot, sales director at digital asset trading platform CrossTower also claimed that over the course of the past couple of weeks, his firm has observed a 219% increase in daily trading volume as well as a 66% rise in the number of daily average signups over the same time period.Michot also highlighted that since the pullback in mid-March, the market as a whole has experienced a strong bullish reversal. For example, Bitcoin has regained over 210% and Ethereum bounced by 364% since the “Black Thursday” crash of March 11, 2020. The crypto market rally has come on the heels of positive news such as the U.S. OCC’s recent clarification permitting the custody of Bitcoin by banks as well as the announcement of another stimulus package to be issued by the Fed in the near future, which some experts believe will continue to devalue the U.S. dollar.On July 12, Bitcoin’s long-term sentiment score — a comparison of investor sentiment over the last 50 days vs. the prior 200 — hit a new all-time high leading up to Bitcoin’s run at the end of the month. Similarly, the daily sentiment score represents a measure of how positive or negative conversations on Twitter have been about a particular coin over the last 24 hours vs. the previous 20 days. The daily sentiment score of investors has remained positive (above 50) every day from July 20 to Aug. 1. Even after Bitcoin failed to surpass the $12,000 mark and retraced by $1,400, investor sentiment fell below 50 for only about 28 hours, alluding to the fact that investors have remained extremely positive on Bitcoin.Frank told Cointelegraph that approximately 68% of all tweets discussing the long-term financial future of Bitcoin over the past month have been positive. Similarly, Michot added that according to CrossTower’s media data, the market is in the early stages of a new bull run, adding: “Another positive sentiment is coming from family offices and other traditional advisory firms. These firms are seeing increased demands by clients seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency markets.”Since the start of the recent crypto surge, there has been a spike in the use of stablecoins along with a clear increase in demand for other DeFi-related tokens. John Todaro, director of institutional research at TradeBlock, a trading platform for institutional investors, told Cointelegraph:“Stablecoin circulating supplies have increased substantially over the past 6 months, with Tether seeing around $10bn in deposits and USDC seeing over $1bn. This may seem small, but those deposits make Circle and Tether, to an extent, defacto banks with sizable customer deposits. $5–10 bn in customer deposits is equivalent to a small to midsize U.S. commercial bank.”Todaro added that while merchant adoption still remains limited for stablecoins, there is real demand for these assets in developing economies as well as those with political instability, such as in Latin America, parts of the Middle East, and to an extent, Hong Kong. He also noted that derivatives volumes have spiked recently (at Deribit, CME and others), but a large portion of that is tied to price action, as increased volatility almost always tends to drive increased trade volumes. Vinokourov believes that the recent spell of low volatility and thin trading volumes has evolved into one of the busiest periods for digital assets in recent memory: “Volumes on spot and derivatives venues spiked higher as Bitcoin traded over $11,000, and other large cap assets followed in lockstep.” Vinokourov further opined: “Particular attention ought to be paid to the evolution of Ethereum volatility profile which, despite coming off recent highs, remains elevated relative to Bitcoin. This suggests more potential volatility for the second largest cryptocurrency.”Another aspect worth exploring is the relationship that may or may not exist between Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index and its price, and if the metric can suggest a possible price direction. Expounding his views on the matter, Todaro opined that the index is calculated based on a few variables that are, to an extent, affected by price, forcing the index to follow certain niche inputs such as the velocity of price gains, all-time high prices and price momentum, among other parameters.For instance, if there is a large crash in the market, volatility will increase, and the index will conclude that the market has high fear. In doing so, the index ultimately follows the price. Additionally, the index captures Google trends, with high interest in positive crypto-related terms meaning high greed. Therefore, Todaro believes that the index can be used to make current and future investment decisions:""While the price of Bitcoin isn’t back to all-time highs, this was the fastest price gain over a 10-day period in its history, which would read extremely greedy, and so maybe it is time to sell and wait for a pullback to re-enter.”Another correlation worth exploring is the one between Bitcoin and the S&P 500. According to Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan, the previously high correlation between crypto-assets and the S&P 500 has now decreased:“We can clearly see earlier this year, where the correlation spiked up to 0.6 due to the multi-asset early-pandemic sell-off. By now, however, we’re once again below 0.2, which basically means that there is no correlation on a day-to-day basis anymore.”Furthermore, Greenspan noted that even a peak of 0.6 only represents a very loose correlation, adding, “Many stocks have a very high correlation with each other, usually above 0.8 even if they’re in completely different industries, and many altcoins are similar.”"
69,"Law enforcement authorities in Kyrgyzstan have reportedly detected an illegal cryptocurrency mining farm on the territory of a local free economic zone (FEZ).The State Service for Combating Economic Crimes, an anti-corruption service in the Kyrgyz Republic, has reportedly discovered a large-scale mining farm at FEZ Bishkek. Kyrgyz authorities posted a video of the facility on YouTube on Aug. 7.During on-site inspections, local enforcement officials found crypto mining devices connected to electricity and the Internet. According to local news agency 24.kg, authorities have launched an investigation into the origins of miners and energy sources.Members of local government organizations and executives from the FEZ were allegedly involved in running and covering up the illicit crypto mining facility.Located in the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, FEZ Bishkek is a territory for the creation and expansion of private business in the Kyrgyz Republic. According to its website, FEZ Bishkek has been running for more than 20 years to date. Known for its cheap energy prices, Kyrgyzstan has emerged as a popular destination for global cryptocurrency mining firms. In 2019, local energy officials announced that the government cut off power to 45 crypto mining firms as they consumed more energy than three local regions combined. In July 2020, Kyrgyzstan’s Parliament considered a bill to tax and regulate crypto mining activities to increase government revenue from the emerging industry."
70,"The United States’ failure to agree on Coronavirus stimulus shows that the dollar is “funny money” and endorses Bitcoin (BTC), says Cameron Winklevoss.In a tweet on Aug. 6, the Gemini exchange co-founder delivered a damning appraisal of the lack of progress in Washington to deliver more financial aid.Talks between Democrats and Republicans were “on the brink of collapse,” CNN reported on Friday, as the two sides’ desired stimulus totals differed by several trillion dollars.For Winklevoss, the idea that politicians could plan for the same goal with wildly varying sums of money said more about the value of the dollar than their differences.“The US dollar has become such funny money that politicians are now ‘trillions of dollars apart’ in stimulus negotiations. Remember when a billion was a big number?” he wrote. “If this isn't a wakeup call and an endorsement of Bitcoin, I don't know what is.”His comments come as USD weakness plays out in an investors’ rush to safe havens, with both Bitcoin and precious metals seeing significant gains. Meanwhile, brother Tyler Winklevoss weighed in on the news that Goldman Sachs, historically risk-averse on Bitcoin, had hired a dedicated head of digital assets.“Now Goldman Sachs is into Bitcoin. What an about face from their ‘Don't Buy Bitcoin’ Report issued 3 months ago in May,” he commented.As Cointelegraph reported, the trend may well continue if the Federal Reserve enacts measures to boost inflation from 0.6% to 2%–4%, something which would be “wildly bullish” for gold at least, one analyst said this week.Regardless of the stimulus deal reached by the government, the expansion of the money supply and artificial shoring up of markets will inevitably embolden Bitcoin proponents.The Fed’s balance sheet stood at $6.94 trillion on Aug. 7, with U.S. gross national debt at $26.6 trillion or $214,000 per taxpayer.Federal Reserve balance sheet year-to-date chart.

For example, the Turkish lira plunged to a record low against Bitcoin earlier this week, with investors questioning the country’s ability to prop up the value of its ailing currency. Elsewhere, the combined balance sheet of the G4 nations’ central banks has ballooned so much that it makes gold’s rise to all-time USD highs look insignificant.“Many of us own gold to offset the dilutive effects on fiat currency of the growth in major central bank’s balance sheets. However, the BS of the G4 has outpaced the rise in gold,” Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor and Real Vision Group, tweeted on Thursday, uploading comparative charts.Continuing, Pal noted a significant advantage of Bitcoin over gold in this respect, despite its latent gains versus the precious metal.He summarized:“In fact, only one asset has offset the growth of the G4 balance sheet. It’s not socks, not bonds, not commodities, not credit, not precious metals, not miners. Only one asset massively outperformed over almost any time horizon. Yup. #Bitcoin $BTC.”"

72,"Researchers at the Technical University of Munich are encouraging regulators to look beyond Bitcoin when it comes to considering the environmental impact of crypto mining.According to an Aug. 4 issue of scientific journal Joule, researchers Ulrich Gallersdörfer, Lena Klaaßen, and Christian Stoll determined that Bitcoin (BTC) mining accounted for only 66% of the total power usage of the 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.“Based on the underlying algorithms, current hash rates, and suitable mining devices, we conclude that Bitcoin accounts for 2/3 of the total energy consumption, and understudied cryptocurrencies represent the remaining 1/3,” the report stated:“Therefore, understudied currencies add nearly 50% on top of Bitcoin’s energy hunger, which already alone may cause considerable environmental damage.” The study determined the power consumption of altcoins by analyzing their hash rates and mining equipment. The blockchains included Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR), Dash (DASH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Zcash (ZEC), DogeCoin (DOGE), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Decred (DCR), RavenCoin (RVN), MonaCoin (MONA), Bytom (BTM), SiaCoin (SC), DigiByte (DGB), Horizen (ZEN), Komodo (KMD), and Bytecoin (BCN).The research team emphasized that while cryptocurrency mining’s energy requirements are a cause of concern for environmentalists, many studies focus exclusively on Bitcoin rather than all cryptocurrencies.“Energy consumption, per se, is not an issue in the context of climate change,” the report stated. However, it stated that crypto mining creates an unexpected load which requires  additional resources. “The increase in full-load hours of certain generation resources may lead to fuel switching effects and alter local emission intensities,” thereby worsening the environmental effects. Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney noted as early as 2009 that mining had the potential to create an environmental nightmare due to its energy requirements, and this was prior to the creation of altcoins. According to the Digiconomist, the collective power consumption of the Bitcoin mining network as of today — roughly 63.5 terawatt-hours — eclipses the power consumption of several developed countries, including Switzerland.Most of the power for Bitcoin mining already comes from renewable energy sources. According to a Dec. 2019 report from research firm CoinShares, roughly 73% of BTC mining is powered by renewable energy.One solution proposed to address the energy consumption of mining crypto is converting excess gas produced while mining oil into electricity. By setting up mining operations in containers at the fields, there is no need to set up pipelines or waste excess gas. The operations simply turn the surplus gas or oil into electricity to power the mining rigs."
73,"Researchers at Coin Metrics found that investors who dollar-cost averaged into Bitcoin (BTC) since the $20,000 peak in 2017 would still be profitable. According to researchers, an investor who continuously bought BTC over the past three years would have a 61.8% return.Although the price of Bitcoin fell significantly from $20,000, there were extreme low points in 2019 and 2020. Investors who capitalized on these strong downtrends will easily be sitting on handsome profits today. Coin Metrics said:“Despite Bitcoin still trading 30% below ATHs, dollar cost averaging from the peak of the market in Dec 2017 would have return [sic] 61.8%, or 20.1% annually. Similarly for Ethereum (still down 71% from its peak), dollar cost averaging from Jan 2018 would have return [sic] 87.6%, or 27.9% annually.”Graph illustrating positive BTC return from dollar-cost averaging.

Some companies were cautiously optimistic towards cryptocurrencies, but the majority kept their distance from the newly-emerging asset class.Over time, as the price of Bitcoin has recovered strongly from extreme corrections to $3,150 and $3,600, investor sentiment changed. In June, JPMorgan, whose CEO publicly criticized Bitcoin in 2018, said the top cryptocurrency has staying power.A team of JPMorgan strategists led by Joshua Younger and Nikolaos Panigirtzoglo also emphasized that the March crash showed Bitcoin’s longevity. Both analysts said:“That suggests that there is little evidence of run dynamics, or even material quality tiering among cryptocurrencies, even during the throws of the crisis in March.”As billionaire investor and hedge fund legend Paul Tudor Jones said, Bitcoin strengthens each day it survives. Compared to other asset classes, BTC is still relatively young, which makes it attractive to investors.The longevity, staying power, and resilience of Bitcoin have allowed the digital asset to recover fairly quickly from large pullbacks. This cycle of high peaks and extremely low bottoms make cost-averaging a profitable method of gaining exposure to Bitcoin.The data also shows that Bitcoin’s price trends are largely cyclical, an additional feature which makes cost-averaging more effective. Coin Metrics announcement also coincides with Bitcoin’s realized price surpassing $6,000 for the first time in history. Realized cap or price attempts to discover the price every investor bought Bitcoin at historically. Glassnode describes the metric as follows:“Realized Cap values different parts of the supplies at different prices (instead of using the current daily close). Specifically, it is computed by valuing each UTXO by the price when it was last moved.”Bitcoin’s realized price reaches $6,000.

Source: Glassnode.Morehead thinks this is still possible, despite the fact that in just one year, the asset’s price would have to increase to nearly 10 times its current value. Yet, his personal prediction is a little more modest, he said:“My common response is it's been growing at 209% for nine years, I think it's going to grow at least 209% over the next couple years and that puts you at $100 000, probably in two years; but I do think that will happen.”If Bitcoin continues to grow at 209% annually, then it will reach the $100,000 mark in 1.92 years. If it were to reach $115,000 in just one year, that would require a 900% annual growth rate.Morehead also noted that he is tired of skeptics who constantly pose the question “What is Bitcoin’s killer app?”. In his opinion, Bitcoin itself is the killer app and its primary use case is a store of value. Bitcoin does it better than gold, which has a market capitalization of $9 trillion, purported Morehead."
80,"Recent data shows that Sunday evening is the best time to buy Bitcoin (BTC) according to Capriole digital asset manager Charles Edwards. As shown below, historically, BTC saw higher returns on Sunday evenings into early Monday morning.Bitcoin shows higher returns on Sunday evenings. Source: Charles EdwardsEdwards said:“Bored on Sunday at midnight? It just so happens to be the best time to buy Bitcoin.”There are several reasons Bitcoin might perform better as the weekend comes to an end. First, the weekend typically records a lower volume, which raises the chances of high volatility. Second, traditional markets that facilitate Bitcoin trades, like CME, close during weekends. As they open, it could cause a spike in volatility.During the weekend, as traditional markets close, trading volume at Bitcoin exchanges also tends to drop off. When there are fewer active traders in the market, it leaves the market vulnerable to more volatile price action.As an example, on July 25 and 26, the BTC/USDT pair on Binance recorded a daily volume of 40,000 BTC and 65,000 BTC respectively. Then, on July 27, which was a Monday, the volume abruptly surged to 150,000 BTC. Coincidentally, the price of Bitcoin also rose by 11%.BTC-USD price and volume surge on Monday, July 27. Source: TradingView.comDue to low Bitcoin trading volume during the weekend, BTC also tends to see sudden pullbacks. For instance, on Sunday, Aug 2, the price of BTC abruptly dropped by 6% overnight. This led to a volume spike, countering the above mentioned data.The CME Bitcoin futures market and its closure during the weekend could also be impacting Bitcoin’s strong performances on Mondays. Similar to the U.S. stock market, CME closes its markets over the weekend and on national holidays. Accredited and institutional investors that use the CME Bitcoin futures market have to wait until the market opens on Monday. Unlike traditional assets, BTC is traded through the weekend and holidays on exchanges. Hence, when CME closes and opens on a Monday, there is usually a gap in price.The CME gap fill is a theory that is widely recognized within the cryptocurrency market. Data shows that the Bitcoin exchange market usually moves to fill the gap between CME and the rest of the market. Consequently, following a weekend, Bitcoin often sees a major price action.On Aug 2, when BTC declined by 6% within hours, more than $1 billion worth of futures contracts were wiped out. This coincidentally happened in the closing weekend of July, which is when the CME Bitcoin futures contract closes. The CME futures contract specification reads:“Trading terminates at 4:00 p.m. London time on the last Friday of the contract month. If this is not both a London and U.S. business day, trading terminates on the prior London and the U.S. business day.”In recent weeks, the open interest of the CME Bitcoin futures market has significantly increased and this could possibly be a reflection of how CME is increasing its influence over the global Bitcoin market. It’s also possible that the data is purely coincidental and reduced trading volume on weekends is the primary reason for Sunday’s offering ‘discounted’ Bitcoin prices."
81,"Since the “digital Sleeping Beauty,” Bitcoin (BTC), woke up about two months after its third halving in mid-May 2020, we have read a lot about the “funding rate” of digital assets futures — from good to completely misleading reports. We just wanted to chime in on that trendy topic.First, it is important to understand what this “funding rate” is, as it only relates to digital assets derivatives. In traditional finance, futures contracts in which prices are derived from the spot price of the same underlying asset have a predefined expiration: monthly and/or quarterly. Small divergences can occur between the spot price and the future price link to the same instrument, but these divergences disappear when the futures expire, assuring the holder of a future the same price at expiration as the spot price of the same underlying crypto. These divergences tend to be transient, as the futures market is very efficient, and any discrepancy leading to arbitrage between futures and spot prices is quickly removed by experienced traders.With digital assets, exchanges on which they trade have provided a new kind of futures: perpetual swaps. Perpetual swaps are tradable instruments linked to the spot price of the same underlying asset, mimicking the spot price of the instrument but without detaining it physically, just like traditional futures. However, they differ in the sense that they never expire, thus allowing investors to hold a position for as long as they want — assuming they maintain enough collateral, but this characteristic of futures is out of the scope of this article.Therefore, an extra mechanism is required to maintain the price of the perpetual swap in line with the spot price of the instrument. This extra mechanism consists of making investors pay extra to hold a perpetual swap position, whose price would be below the spot price otherwise, thus annihilating the arbitrage opportunity or paying them if they’re holding a perpetual swap position that would be otherwise priced above the spot price of the same underlying asset and vice versa. This mechanism — i.e., the fee paid or received — is called the funding rate. It is typically assessed three times a day in order to adjust to the market movements. This fee typically ranges between three and 15 basis points per eight-hour cycle.During strong market moves or periods of high volatility, the price of the perpetual swap can differ more than during quiet/low volatility periods, leading to a higher funding rate in order to reduce/close the gap between the perpetual swap and the spot price.Let’s have a look at an example of the funding rate. One can see the increasing rate over the last few days of July 2020 when Bitcoin broke out.By construction, the funding rate is a lagging indicator of the volatility of the underlying asset, contrary to what we’ve been told. Indeed, the more the spot price moves, the more the funding rate increases and vice versa, but the price always leads the funding rate, not the other way around.However, the higher the funding rate, the larger the divergence will be between the perpetual swap and the spot price, which confirms strong interest from investors to either buy or sell the underlying crypto.Increasing volume is also a sign of strong interest from investors, but it can be faked as demonstrated by several studies.The funding rate can be seen as true confirmation of strong interest to buy or sell the related instrument: A high positive funding rate confirms the buying interest, whereas a high negative funding rate confirms the selling pressure, as was the case mid-March 2020. A diminishing funding rate from the highs means less interest from investors, but it doesn’t mean the price of the underlying asset is about to reverse, meaning quieter movements in the underlying asset.Astute traders can use the funding rate as an indicator to adjust any potential leverage on a position in two ways. An increasing funding rate means more confirmation of a movement, either up or down according to the sign of the funding rate. Investors can decide to either leverage their position more — as the move of the underlying crypto is strong and expected to last from a few hours to a few days — to take advantage of the move, or if they are already leveraged during normal moves — i.e., confirmed by a low funding rate — they can reduce their usual leverage in order to keep risk exposure more or less stable over time.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

CEO Hong Fang said, “Supporting Marco’s work on strengthening the testing framework in addition to his general responsibilities as a maintainer is important to continuing quality development.” This grant will allow Falke to focus on modularizing the Bitcoin Core code, ensuring that the code is clearly segmented in order for developers to have a targeted focus. “Developers are typically good at supporting specific pieces of the code and this helps to clarify the responsibilities,” said Falke, adding that his work will also benefit users:“Modularizing the code also provides user advantages; you can turn off modules, like the miner module, or the mempool module, which means you can run Bitcoin Core with less computational resources.”Falke will also continue his work as a Bitcoin Core Maintainer, reviewing other contributions to ensure they are aligned with the community’s requirements while supporting new contributors to help them make an impact. “Educating new volunteers on the project and how the consensus model functions is a really important part of building the community. I was given this support when I joined, and so I want to pass it on.”Prior to this grant, Falke was working with Chaincode Labs who have also supported his work on Bitcoin Core. This grant is instrumental in his work having an ongoing impact on the Bitcoin community as a whole. One of the future plans Falkes is working towards is the critical switch of Bitcoin code to C++17. “In two major releases we plan to switch to C++17, which allows us to drop library dependencies in which we have identified bugs” he explained, stating that “without the OKCoin grant, this would not be possible”.The grant’s previous recipients include Bitcoin payment processor BTCPay ($100,000) and individual contributors Fabian Jahr and Amiti Uttarwar ($150,000). Past grant money has been used to support recent developments in user experience for BTCPay Server , improvements to the UTXO set, and functional test framework.Fang explained that through these grants OKCoin will build up a network of active contributors that could collaborate on larger projects:“Our grant recipients don't work for us or the exchange business — they stay on their own open source course. But we are very open to funding and/or contributing our own resources for larger projects that help the crypto industry as a whole.”Grant recipients are not locked in an exclusive contract with OKCoin, she went on to say, suggesting that “the more companies funding developers the better and it is really exciting that we are seeing more and more crypto companies provide grants to Bitcoin devs in 2020."""
86,"After a lengthy joint investigation with the American FBI, German police have seized over 25 millions euros worth of cryptocurrency associated with the illegal movie streaming site movie2k.to.Shuttered in spring 2013 due to copyright infringement concerns, the site’s two main operators are accused of having distributed over 880,000 pirated copies of films, together with their accomplices, via the site between fall 2018 and spring 2013. They have been charged with operating an illegal streaming service, which enabled users to watch pirated films without downloading them.One of the two, who worked as the site’s programmer, has been in police custody since November 2019. On Aug. 3, the Dresden Public Prosecutor's Office, supported by the State Criminal Police Office in Saxony and the Leipzig Tax Investigation Department announced that the programmer had cooperated in forfeiting over 25 million euros ($29.6 million) worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Since mid-2012, the two main operators are alleged to have used profits from advertising fees on movie2k.to and subscription revenue to buy large amounts of Bitcoin. The site’s programmer is alleged to have acquired in excess of 22,000 BTC from this, later using the crypto primarily to acquire various properties via a Berlin real estate firm.He is also reportedly under suspicion of commercial money laundering in connection with his activities as a real estate entrepreneur in Berlin.Tracing and identifying the associated Bitcoin was reportedly carried out through joint investigative work between the German Federal Criminal Police Office and the FBI.The forfeited Bitcoin has been seized as damage reparation by the public prosecutor after their voluntary release by the defendant. The programmer has now comprehensively confessed to the charges and is reported to be supporting  law enforcement authorities in their further investigations into the second main operator, who remains on the run.As German newspaper Der Spiegel has reported, movie2k.to was — alongside kino.to and neu.to — one of the world's leading platforms for the distribution of illegal pirated movies for years . In 2012, the main founder and operator of kino.to was sentenced to a prison term of up to four and a half years."
87,"Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges lost 100,000 BTC during the weekend’s price crash, data shows — and that’s a bullish sign.Figures from on-chain monitoring resource CryptoQuant on Aug. 5 tracking exchange balances show a dramatic drop occurring just after BTC/USD shed $1,200 in minutes.Prior to the turbulent weekend’s trading, Bitcoin balances on exchanges totalled approximately 2.49 million BTC ($29.2 billion). Afterwards, the ledger fell to 2.39 million BTC ($28 billion) — the lowest ever recorded by CryptoQuant.According to popular analyst Cole Garner, the change is yet another hint that the overall mood among investors is extremely optimistic. “The amount of #Bitcoin held on exchanges just dropped off a cliff,” he wrote on Twitter on Thursday. “It happened two days ago - whales bought up the selloff. $BTC flowing out of exchanges is *bullish*”As Cointelegraph reported, decreasing numbers of coins held on exchanges suggests that investors plan to hold BTC, not sell or trade it at short notice. Garner agrees.“The only reason to take them off exchange is because you intend to not sell them anytime soon,” he added.Bitcoin exchange reserves 2-week chart. Source: CryptoQuantWhales — those holding conspicuously large amounts of Bitcoin — seemed to have anticipated the pullback far earlier, as coins made their way back to exchanges a week earlier.Commenting on the trend, CryptoQuant offered an alternative but no less bullish explanation involving major exchange Binance. “68101 BTC transferred from Binance to a newly created wallet, and not clear whether it's their new cold wallet or the 3rd party custody,” the firm responded to Garner. “Even if it's Binance's, it could be a bull signal since Binance decided to reduce the portion of hot wallets in charge of user withdrawals.”BTC/USD was heading towards $11,800 at press time, as the remnants of the crash dissipated and $12,000 became a target once again.Earlier this week, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggested that the next correction may be the final opportunity to buy BTC at a discount."

Currently, the price trades near the $11,500 support after bulls were unable to tackle the $11,800 level. Despite a pullback to lower support, Wednesday’s 6.29% push through the $11,100 to $11,250 zone was much needed, as the price had lingered below this level for about three days. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewAs the 4-hour chart shows, once above $11,450, traders were able to slice through the $150 gap on the volume profile visible range and pursue the completion of a W-bottom reversal pattern; however, failure to pierce $11,800 prevented this. As reported by Cointelegraph earlier this week, the Aug. 2 flash crash that saw the Bitcoin price drop $1,500 in minutes and liquidate $1 billion did little to shake the bullish resolve of professional traders.According to GSR market analyst Micah Erstling:“The large percentage of headlines and traditional investors looking for higher yielding assets has led to a larger shift into crypto. As a result, open interest in futures listed on major exchanges reached a new lifetime high of $5.6 billion on August 1, surpassing the previous record of $5.36 billion in February. Given the increased bullish sentiment, funding rates prior to the crash were at unsustainable levels as the funding rate for Bitcoin was hovering around 0.0721%.

89,"Scammers have conned more YouTube viewers into sending them Bitcoin after hacking several more large verified accounts and posting ‘free giveaway’ videos.According to an Aug. 5 tweet posted by Jon Prosser, his Front Page Tech YouTube channel with 262,000 subscribers was hacked by bad actors who changed the name to “NASA [news]” and began live streaming a fake Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway video featuring SpaceX’s Elon Musk.“Hackers have made $4,000 in Bitcoin so far,” said Prosser. “YouTube tells me I need to fill out a form and wait ‘a few weeks.’” Seven years’ worth of Front Page Tech’s videos were deleted by the scammers. YouTube took the channel down roughly two hours after Prosser first noticed the breach, and it remains offline.Crypto scammers have been targeting YouTube channels for months, impersonating high-profile figures like Musk, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Both Garlinghouse and Wozniak have filed separate lawsuits against the platform.However, Prosser’s case is worrying as he reported the hackers used a SIM swap attack to gain access to his channel using its two-factor authentication (2FA). The breach comes just one day after Scott Melker, AKA ‘The Wolf of All Streets’, advised the crypto community to “never use SMS verification as a part of your 2FA,” but rather an authenticator app from a device kept offline.Prosser’s channel wasn’t even the only one targeted this week.Rod Breslau, a gaming consultant for Sony Music Entertainment, reported on Aug. 3 several other channels were live streaming similar SpaceX videos offering BTC giveaways. Talyta Rocha, a “hair influencer” with 155,000 subscribers, was one of the victims. One channel with 295,000 subscribers has been allowed to broadcast an Ethereum (ETH) scam video for more than an hour as of this writing."
90,"Morgan Creek’s Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano says the Federal Reserve’s attempts to control inflation are likely to end in disaster — which will benefit Bitcoin.The Fed is currently completing an annual policy review and reportedly considering a plan to not raise interest rates until inflation hits 2%. In a Aug. 5 letter to subscribers titled The Wizards of The Federal Reserve Pomp said the Fed’s efforts to ramp up inflation has put it “on a path that could end disastrously.”He stated the nature of the U.S. economy means it is “nearly impossible to manipulate with nuanced control” and the central bank has a poor record with inflation targets over the years, having only “come within +/- 10% of that target 3 of the last 10 years.”He described a “worst case scenario” where the Federal Reserve overshoots their inflation target amid worsening economic problems and need to print more stimulus but can’t raise interest rates quickly enough:“If that were to happen, the Federal Reserve would be accelerating inflation at the exact moment that they should be reigning it in. I wish that I could argue that this scenario would be hard to see coming, but rather I think it is actually likely.”Pomp encouraged investors to avoid hoarding cash as the Fed’s efforts contribute to devaluing the dollar. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the currency against six major rivals, fell 3.9% in July, from 97.2 to 93.3.“My anticipation is that real estate, gold, Bitcoin and stocks are all going to run much, much higher than they already have,” said Pomp. “Bitcoin is going to be the largest winner out of all assets since it is the most volatile.”Despite the official inflation rate of roughly 1%, consumer prices across the United States are reportedly surging. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that from February to June, meat and poultry prices rose nearly 11% with the biggest price impact on beef and veal which have increased 20%.The grocery store inflation comes at a bad time for millions of Americans, with the $600 boost to weekly unemployment payments expiring on July 31. Roughly 30 million Americans now collect an average of $1,284 every month instead of $3,684.Democrats and Republicans are pushing their respective plans for stimulus packages, worth between $1 trillion to $3.4 trillion, with a resolution expected by Aug. 7."
91,"Computer scientist and Blockstream CEO, Adam Back, has compared Ethereum and other high-cap altcoins to Ponzi schemes in a Twitter tirade today:“Bitconnect, Charles Ponzi, Ethereum, Onecoin, Cardano, Ripple, Bernie Madoff, Stellar, Dan Larmer. All looking very similar grade to me.”Charles Ponzi and Bernie Madoff are two of the most famous creators of Ponzi-schemes, while Bitconnect and OneCoin are famous cryptocurrency projects that were revealed to be Ponzis. Back likened such schemes to altcoins Ethereum, Ripple and Stellar, along with “Dan Larmer,” presumably a reference to Bitshares and Steem creator Dan Larimer.Back’s swipe came in a dialogue with TV journalist Layah Heilpern, who asked whether he thought Ethereum was a scam or if it added value to the ecosystem in terms of DApps.  Back responded simply:“Well 70% pre-mined says it all. Which would you say is a bigger scam, Ripple or Ethereum.”Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin hit back, calling Back’s views “tired old propaganda”:Reciting tired old propaganda is becoming less and less effective every day. Ethereum is rising, proof of stake and sharding are rising, and rollups are here, all through a large distributed ecosystem working in parallel. The tides of history will not be favorable to maximalism. https://t.co/PZ11XR2PreIt is not the first time that the HashCash proof-of-work inventor has taken a swing at Ethereum. In another tweet exchange in November last year, he compared Ethereum to the now-defunct biotech startup Theranos, which created a fake medical machine. Back argued that management went too far into overselling what it could do while misrepresenting the state of the tech, adding that Theranos was “uncannily Ethereum-like.”The computer scientist has been a Bitcoiner from the beginning and has been linked with Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto several times. He once reportedly claimed to have had a beer with him in London.It’s not difficult to imagine there could be a link between the rapid rise of the Ethereum price this month amid excitement over the DeFi project and a revival of crypto tribalism from Bitcoin true believers.Since the beginning of the year, ETH prices have more than doubled, with the majority of that gain being over the past month. Bitcoin has also gained in price, but not as much. The momentum for Ethereum has been driven by the hope that the long-awaited first phase of the ETH 2.0 shift to a proof-of-stake consensus will be launched within months. If successful, Ethereum will eventually be able to process exponentially more transactions than Bitcoin."
92,"Crypto analyst Mati Greenspan says the correlation between crypto assets and the S&P 500 has fallen significantly since the dramatic sell-offs in tandem early in the pandemic.In the Aug. 5 Quantum Economics newsletter, Greenspan stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto are “once again able to claim independence from the traditional markets.” However the analyst also added that even during the early stages of COVID-19 — roughly March to May — the markets were never more than “loosely correlated.”The following chart represents Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 on a range of 1 (perfect correlation) to -1 (inverse correlation).90-day Pearson correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500. Source: Mati Greenspan“We can clearly see earlier this year, where the correlation spiked up to 0.6 due to the multi-asset early-pandemic sell-off,” Greenspan said. “By now, however, we're once again below 0.2, which basically means that there is no correlation on a day-to-day basis anymore.” Despite these market trends seemingly diverging, Greenspan said there was at least one common factor driving both stock and digital assets: the Federal Reserve.“During periods when the Fed prints money, it sends prices upward in all markets,” he said.Greenspan stated in an Aug. 2 interview that he believed “the bull market is back.”  On July 22, Gemini crypto exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss stated in a tweet that the Fed was continuing “to set the stage for Bitcoin's next bull run"" with further stimulus spending.As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is approaching $11,800, having risen 4.89% in the last 24 hours. This surge comes amid expectations that the U.S. government will announce a second stimulus package on Aug. 7. Democratic leaders are pushing for a $3.4 trillion package, while Republicans are advocating for one worth $1 trillion."
93,"In its August crypto outlook, Bloomberg remained unimpressed with Ethereum, calling its rally “speculative”. The publication contends, however, that Bitcoin’s (BTC) rise is based on solid ground:“Ethereum has extended last year's highs and leaped to one of the top-performing major crypto assets in 2020, but we view its rally as more speculative vs. the favorable demand vs. supply conditions supporting Bitcoin.”The report points out that Ethereum faces “plenty of competition from similar crypto platforms and about 6,000 tradable coins.” On the other hand, Bloomberg has remained consistently bullish about Bitcoin, noting its gold-like qualities and increased institutional demand.The success of the DeFi space has led to the appreciation of Ether, with some comparing it to the ICO boom. As more smart contract platforms mature, competition will only get tougher. When it comes to the world of professional investors, Ether does not have a clear selling point like Bitcoin’s limited supply."

Source: SkewWhether the timing of this increasing correlation is simply due to investors re-entering the market after the Black Thursday crash remains uncertain but it is possible to argue that every asset class, including stocks, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies, fell in mid-March.Another way of analyzing the data could be that the declining U.S. dollar and rising inflation boosted investor sentiment around gold. As safe-haven assets benefited from macro factors, Bitcoin also rallied as more investors began to consider it as a store of value.As gold, silver, and Bitcoin rallied simultaneously since April, the U.S. dollar has underperformed significantly against other reserve currencies.The declining value of the U.S. dollar has positively affected precious metals and Bitcoin in recent months.

96,"Amid the ongoing bull market, a major Bitcoin (BTC) advocate has delivered another promising price prediction for the largest cryptocurrency.Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, believes that Bitcoin will continue to grow in the long-term to break the $400,000 threshold.In an Aug. 4 interview with crypto podcaster Peter McCormack, Pomp said that Bitcoin is poised to eventually hit at least $400,000 or $450,000 price levels with a market capitalization of $8 trillion. According to Pompliano, Bitcoin will steadily break new all-time highs because the cryptocurrency represents a digital version of gold — one of the world's most valuable assets.As per Pompliano, Bitcoin will follow the success of major digitized assets, replacing the analog gold with its digital alternative and eventually expanding the market. Pomp said:“Here’s what I continue to tell people: name to me a business that was analog and got digitized, and the digital version is smaller than the analog version. It doesn’t happen. It’s because digitization brings all kinds of advantages. It’s a market-expanding technology.”Pompliano continued that Bitcoin will eventually become a bigger market than gold. According to Pomp, it might take 50 years before Bitcoin hits $400,000 levels.Pompliano said:“You know there are people who debate what the size of the gold market is but let’s just use easy numbers. Let’s say that it’s $8 trillion. That puts Bitcoin at, depending on how many are lost or stolen, $400,000 to $450,000 today. Do you think that Bitcoin is going to be the equivalent of the gold market? I don’t. It’s better. It’s going to capture more market.”In the interview, Pomp also said that he still keeps his $100,000 BTC prediction, forecasting that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by late 2021. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $11,581 with a market cap of about $214 billion amid the ongoing bull market. In the meantime, gold prices are also surging.

We believe this technology is the next step for future payment systems,” a spokesperson added.The platform is using a Lightning Network node that belongs to OMGFIN, a digital asset exchange that says it “has been supporting the Bitcoin industry since the early days.”Beyond Lightning Network support, Uquid emphasizes that its goal is to offer plenty of choices and to make the shopping process faster by accepting a plethora of cryptocurrencies. Coins such as XRP, Gas, NEO, Tether and the Uquid Coin are also supported.Just some of the items available include games across some of the world’s best-known platforms, including Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation. Crypto can also be used to snap up gift cards and vouchers for software, cell phone credit and popular retailers. Moreover, it’s possible to pay for TV bundles and electricity bills, life insurance, access to the internet, and transportation — the last one courtesy of Uber in the United States. According to the company, brand-new categories are going to be added to the site in the not-too-distant future — spanning health and beauty, food and groceries, and clothing and shoes.Said Tran Hung, the founder and CEO of Uquid, explained: “The Uquid shop is an important piece of our ecosystem that is bringing crypto closer to the real world of services and products. We are and will continue to try harder to achieve this goal.”Uquid has come a long way since its launch in 2016. The company describes itself as one of the earliest cross-border digital service providers with a blockchain-friendly payment system. A priority for the team has been to build the ecosystem organically while continually making improvements that ensure it is safe and secure for its customers.This year has been a major milestone for Uquid, as it began offering business-to-business solutions including crypto payments, blockchain development, social marketing and exchange platform development.The company has long been at the forefront of innovation. Back in 2016, Uquid launched a virtual Visa debit card that can be topped up with more than 90 different cryptocurrencies. Ether, XRP, Litecoin, Monero and Dogecoin were among the altcoins that were supported at launch.Enabling shoppers to use their crypto to make everyday purchases has been a much-needed milestone for the industry. It offers an incentive for consumers who have only ever relied on fiat to give digital assets a go for the very first time. In time, this could help contribute to the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, Ether and other altcoins — and help the industry gain the recognition it deserves.The team behind Uquid’s shop adds that it is helping this ambition to become a reality by offering an “extensive product range that few e-commerce retailers can match.”Disclaimer.

98,"A recent report contends that the Ledger app has failed to fix a major vulnerability that allows for a “Bitcoin Fork” attack.Mo Nokhbeh has claimed that Ledger’s wallet fails to properly isolate the apps responsible for authorizing the transactions of different assets. This creates a vulnerability where a user’s wallet can be fooled into authorizing a transaction for a less valuable asset — such as Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) or any other Bitcoin fork coin — when in reality, a Bitcoin (BTC) transaction is being released. Nokhbeh told Cointelegraph:“This app should be isolated such that it only signs for testnet derivation paths. However, sending it a regular mainnet bitcoin transaction will pass. In addition, it will present the TX as if it's testnet bitcoin, to a testnet bitcoin address.”According to Nokhbeh, he made Ledger fully aware of this vulnerability, and despite acknowledging it, the company has failed to fix it. Instead, they have chosen to release an update to their existing app that will provide users with a warning prompt if such an exploit is detected.We have reached out to Ledger for comment and will update pending a response."
99,"In its crypto outlook for August, Bloomberg contends that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing at six times the price of an ounce of gold. This speculation came shortly after the correlation between the two assets reached an all-time high.Bitcoin and Gold price chart. Source: Trading Economics.Bloomberg has professed for some time now that Bitcoin is on the verge of becoming digital gold. This is due to the asset’s inherently similar qualities, such as a limited supply and a low growth rate. The company is now taking its hypothesis a step further by claiming that there is a price ratio relationship between the assets:“Stabilizing at about 6x the per-ounce price of gold, Bitcoin's increasing correlation and declining volatility relative to the precious metal indicate an enduring relationship for price advancement, in our view. Unparalleled global central-bank easing should remain a tailwind for the quasi-currencies.”It is unclear why there would be a mathematical relationship between the prices of these two assets at present. However, if this relationship persists into the future, the price of Bitcoin may appreciate to $18,000. To this effect, Bloomberg sees “the potential upside in spot gold toward $3,000 an ounce”.Bloomberg also believes there is an on-chain indicator which backs up the idea that Bitcoin is currently undervalued:“The 30-day average of addresses from Coinmetrics on Aug. 4 translated to a Bitcoin price above $14,000, vs. about $11,000 on an auto-scale basis since 2017.”The report points to the continued expansion of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust Fund, or GBTC, as a significant factor in diminishing Bitcoin’s available supply “GBTC inflows over the past year have absorbed about a third of new Bitcoin supply. If the inflow pace doesn't subside, absorption will approach 50%, with less supply.”Bloomberg says that something unexpected would need to happen to prevent Bitcoin’s advance in the face of prevailing “zero and negative interest rates”."

Source: Coin360Excitement remains palpable for Bitcoin, which has spent the week slowly patching up losses after it fell $1,200 from highs of $12,000 on Sunday.Bitcoin could surge higher if the United States Federal Reserve seeks to raise inflation in a move that “doesn’t make any sense.”In an address last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the results of a year-long review which would dictate future policy could come as soon as next month.This, as CNBC reported on Aug. 4, would mean the Fed sticks to lower interest rates for the year in order to get inflation to a target of 2%. Annual inflation to June was 0.6%.As a result, recent all-time highs for safe-haven assets should continue, with gold, silver and potentially Bitcoin all feeling the benefits of the Fed’s measures.Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told the publication that a 2% inflation target would see “real yields persistently lower, the dollar lower, volatility lower, credit spreads lower and equities higher.”It would be “wildly bullish” for both gold and silver, he added.Bitcoin has recently copied the record rise of safe havens, with press-time levels passing $11,600 on the back of quarterly gains of almost 60%.As Cointelegraph reported on Wednesday, multiple statistics show a surge of interest and investment in the cryptocurrency over the past few months. Continuing, another analyst warned that a shift to higher inflation would cause more pain for the average consumer and fly in the face of logic.“It doesn’t make any economic sense whatsoever,” CNBC quoted Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, as saying. “The consumer is very fragile right now. The last thing we should be shooting for is a higher cost of living.”Summarizing the plans, Gabor Gurbacs, a strategist at Bitcoin-friendly investment manager VanEck, painted a grim future for the U.S. dollar and those who hold it.“The two options with fiat money is to spend it fast before it inflates or put it in speculative markets artificially propped up by central bank printed money,” he wrote on Twitter. “Fiat money is not a savings instrument. The average person doesn’t understand this.”Meanwhile, another indicator of potential further gains for Bitcoin came in the form of its relationship to the VIX volatility index this week.As noted by Brave New Coin analyst Josh Olszewicz, declines in VIX typically spell gains for BTC/USD, with the downtrend continuing for several months.“Historically extremely bullish for BTC,” he tweeted.

101,"From performing simple commands on smartphones using Alexa or Siri to high-end technical operations in big tech firms, one thing is sure: Ease is a necessity in the modern human experience.The 21st century has marked a rapid advancement of technology in every aspect of human life and interactions. Despite being around for many decades, the replication of human intelligence in machines — artificial intelligence — has now become popularized. With many tech companies rushing to adopt the technology, the market size is expected to grow to $126 billion in 2025.Similarly, distributed ledger technology and cryptocurrencies have exceeded everyone’s expectations and are looking to compete with traditional fiat currencies. With AI and cryptocurrencies to become formidable fortresses, how does artificial intelligence impact distributed ledger technology?Related: Talking Digital Future: Artificial IntelligenceAfter the emergence of blockchain technology in the post-crisis era, the industry has continued to attract a significant number of investors and prove doubters wrong. In December 2017, Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to an all-time high price of $20,000. Cryptocurrency trading continued to gain more attention, and the industry now has a market capitalization of over $339 billion.As more investors join the blockchain space, the impact of AI becomes increasingly significant to crypto trading. By developing fast, effective and impartial AI trading bots, cryptocurrency traders have avoided slippage and performed accurate technical and fundamental analyses to make better trading decisions. Ultimately, many traders have increased their profits while seeing considerably low losses.The blockchain industry has suffered a high level of malware, phishing and 51% attacks, among other corrupt endeavors. An estimated $9 million is lost to cryptocurrency scams every day. So long as the technology exists, security and a means of protecting users from fraud will always be a hot topic.Blockchain hacks and attacks are usually very time-sensitive, with the first response to the hack being critical. However, many crypto exchanges haven’t been lucky in dealing with hacks. Fortunately, AI-based cybersecurity systems are designed to identify threats in real time, understand the nature of the threat and prevent future attacks by blacklisting its source.Unlike traditional cybersecurity systems, AI is designed to improve with every threat because of its ability to detect patterns, study them and become better at dealing with them.To maintain the blockchain’s integrity, transactions are verified and added by Bitcoin miners. Bitcoin miners are, in turn, rewarded in cryptocurrency. However, the process is painstaking, sensitive and energy-consuming, and ultimately requires many graphic processing units, or GPUs.In a bid to conserve energy and maximize computing power, many mining companies turn to AI-based GPUs. Some mining companies have created AI-based ecosystems where miners can share and economize computing power while making considerable profits. With these unique AI algorithms, Bitcoin mining becomes faster, more efficient and more profitable. In 2017, a popular blockchain manufacturing company, Bitmain, increased its operations to include AI in the chips of its application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs.Without a doubt, while technology in general is largely shifting toward machine learning and artificial intelligence, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are equally benefitting from the evolution of artificial intelligence.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Joshua Esan is a freelance writer and editor passionate about blockchain technology and the health industry.

Originally from the United States, David Brian Pate is a darknet vendor who along with Costa Rican pharmacist Jose Luis Hou sold drugs worth 23,903 Bitcoin (BTC) — approximately $270 million — to darknet customers.The jury charged Pate and Hou for conspiring to distribute controlled substances, distributing controlled substances, conspiring to import these substances and conspiring to launder money and money instruments. According to the statement published by the Department of Justice, Pate illegally purchased narcotics such as OxyContin and morphine pills from the Costa Rican pharmacist Fung and laundered payments to him.Pate advertised his drugs using numerous online handles, claiming he was selling the “old formula” of the OxyContin that could be crushed and inhaled or injected. The new version of the drug is tamper-resistant and cannot be crushed.He sold the drugs on various darknet markets including the famous SilkRoad and Alphabay in exchange for Bitcoin payments. To deliver his drugs to the customers, Pate sent bulk shipments from Costa Rica along with a list of customers and their order details to his partner re-shippers in the U.S. The re-shippers then created smaller packages and mailed them to customers.Upon every delivery, the marketplace released the Bitcoin payment from the escrow wallet to Pate’s Bitcoin wallet.Speaking on the matter, the Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin said, “These charges are a warning to drug traffickers worldwide that neither the shroud of the darknet nor of virtual currency can hide their illegal activities from the vigilance of U.S. law enforcement.”"

Clark along with 22-year-old Nima Fazeli of Orlando and Mason Sheppard, 19 of the United Kingdom allegedly carried out the hack in July to gain access to at least 130 Twitter accounts of high-profile people and companies including Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Apple, among others.The perpetrators allegedly used the accounts to post tweets asking people to send any amount of Bitcoin (BTC) to a specified wallet address, promising them they would receive double the amount in return. They were able to dupe Twitters users of almost $117,000 in about three hours of the hack.The two others involved in the hack, Fazeli and Sheppard, face similar charges in the California federal court. Fazeli may face a five-year jail term and a fine of up to $250,000 while Sheppard is subject to 45 years in prison and a $750,000 fine.Investigators found that the plan for the hack began with a Discord user by the username Kirk#5270, who also claimed to be a Twitter employee, connecting with Fazeli and Sheppard. He reportedly promised the two that he would access and take control of the Twitter accounts in return for Bitcoin transfers. The two hackers had then purportedly posted the offer on OGUsers, a marketplace popular among hackers. The FBI found that the data of OGUsers’ was hacked in April and information such as public forum postings, private messages, internet addresses and email addresses were posted on the internet. Skimming through this data, the FBI traced the accounts of Fazeli and Sheppard and also found transactions made by them over Coinbase.They then received the photos of a driver's licence of both the hackers, posted as a KYC document on the platform, and moved ahead with the arrest.

105,"The alleged dealers involved in “Chemical Revolution” — Germany’s largest darknet narcotics marketplace — will stand trial today.The high number of initial defendants in the case has meant the trial is being held in a congress hall in Giessen, central Germany, large enough to accommodate the proceedings.While seven defendants are standing trial today, a total of 11 persons were arrested back in June 2019 in connection with the case. They were charged with selling vast quantities of drugs — including MDMA, amphetamine, heroin, cocaine and cannabis — to consumers in exchange for Bitcoin (BTC).

If Bitcoin stays above $11,500 by Aug. 10, it would be the highest weekly close for BTC price since mid-2019. The weekly candle in August 2019 closed slightly above $11,500. In other words, a close above this level would print the best weekly candle since the 2017 bull run. Meanwhile, traders are closely observing the upcoming weekly candle closure because many believe it could decide whether the bull market continues.

He said:“Firstly note that a breakout is bullish if it can be successfully defended, meaning as long as $BTC can remain above the breakout trend line it has significant technical room higher… But note that inside the larger wedge consolidation a potentially much more bullish pattern has emerged, that of a potential inverse which would point to near 17,000.”A technical case for an extended Bitcoin bull trend. Source: NorthmanTraderIn the near-term, analysts point toward various macro factors that could boost the sentiment around Bitcoin. Most notably, the value of the United States dollar is depreciating.Overall, trading volumes across various markets, including retail and institutional, are increasing. For example, the open interest of the CME Bitcoin futures market has just hit a record high. Despite mass liquidations on Aug. 2, BTC has remained relatively stable above the key technical support level at $10,500.While more factors seemingly buoy the bull case for Bitcoin, there are two risks BTC faces in the short term. First, until $12,000 clearly breaks, the risk of overhead resistance remains. Second, several technical metrics, including funding rates and greed index (currently at 75% or “greed”), hint at an overheated rally.However, it is uncertain whether positive on-chain metrics, such as the number of “HODLers” reaching an all-time high, can offset potential risks.

110,"Popular Twitter personality Dave Portnoy, famous for his motto “stocks only go up,” now wants to learn about Bitcoin (BTC) from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.In a Twitter clip extracted from his latest daily show on August 4, Portnoy tells the Winklevoss twins he’d like them to “explain Bitcoin in a way that I would understand,” he said.Portnoy stressed that he wants them to come in “their little rowing outfits,” in a reference to the movie The Social Network, where they were shown competing in Harvard’s rowing team.Both Tyler and Cameron accepted the invite shortly after. Portnoy recounted how he once bought BTC in “that original Bitcoin age” but lost all access to it. “I’ve spent 20 grand, it’s just sitting in the ether,” he lamented in what appeared to be an accidental pun.He said that he does not know how to buy Bitcoin or how to maintain self custody of the asset once acquired, which is why he wants the Winklevoss twins to come and explain it to him. He also revealed in passing that he had already talked to them about this, but “they wanted a free ad.” Portnoy on the other hand wants “to get rich” by learning about it.A viewer appears to have suggested he buys Chainlink (LINK) as well, though he immediately replied “I don’t know how, I’ve already explained.”Portnoy is the founder of Barstool Sports, a sports news website. Since the coronavirus lockdowns, he has immersed himself in the world of daily stock trading, reportedly to make up for the closure of sports betting. He makes daily videos about his fortunes and misfortunes in the stock market, famously saying phrases like “stocks only go up” or “I have as much experience as Joe Dick Tom Warren Buffet.”He reportedly inspired his followers to enter the stock market through retail platforms like Robinhood, though he is known for using E*Trade.Portnoy and the Davey Day Trader persona are considered the poster child of irrational exuberance that led to events like Hertz’s post-bankruptcy rally or Dogecoin’s TikTok-fueled Rally.The sudden interest in Bitcoin could be due to plunging profits in the stock market, as the latest rally is primarily led by a few very large stocks like Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. Earlier in the Tuesday show, he complained of a $40,000 loss on Shopify.While the latest events could result in publicity for Bitcoin among stock traders who follow Portnoy, the interest is unlikely to last longer than the current rally."

112,"A famous Bitcoin skeptic has called for a gold-backed currency to save Turkey as its national fiat currency collapses.In a tweet on Monday, John Hopkins professor Steve Hanke argued that hard money was now the only way out for Turkey, which has spent billions of dollars propping up the lira.At press time, those efforts were still in vain, as another day of intense selling sent the lira to a record low against various currencies including the euro and Bitcoin (BTC).Weakness in the United States dollar meant that the lira–dollar pair avoided a record of its own, nonetheless dropping to its lowest levels since May.“#Turkey’s #Lira is toast,” Hanke declared.  “The central bank’s net foreign assets are a staggering negative $32 billion. Turkey has run out of ammunition in its futile defense of the hopeless lira. Only a gold-backed currency board can save the lira.”BTC/TRY lifetime chart. Source: TradingViewTurkey’s situation is reminiscent of that which engulfed Russia in 2014 as the Ukraine crisis sparked a rout that saw the central bank continually selling foreign exchange reserves to steady the ruble.“They’re intervening quite heavily. And the question is how long they can do that,” a strategist at Dutch bank Rabobank told the Financial Times last week.Ankara has taken a laissez-faire approach to Bitcoin regulation, with a lack of formal recognition ironically contrasting with moves such as banning PayPal in 2016.Hanke is well known for preferring other safe-haven assets to BTC, which he described in June as “not a currency.” He joins the likes of Peter Schiff in his support for gold, which itself is at $1,975 — an all-time high in U.S. dollar terms.Interventionist strategies on the part of governments and central banks when it comes to currency forms a major argument in favor of Bitcoin as an alternative. As Saifedean Ammous notes in his now ubiquitous book The Bitcoin Standard, the foreign exchange leverage that Turkey is now using only came about because governments removed the gold backing of their respective currencies.In a timely post this week, Ammous highlighted a 1957 essay by Ludwig von Mises as an essential weapon against bowing to what he called the “inflationist nonsense” of fiat.“Nothing is more important today than to enlighten public opinion about the basic differences between genuine liberalism, which advocates the free market economy, and the various interventionist parties which are advocating government interference,” Mises concluded."
113,"The United States dollar index is currently testing the bottom of a 12-year trendline. But some traders are calling it the “most pivotal moment” for the global reserve currency since 2008, as they believe that continuous depreciation will likely boost the price of Bitcoin (BTC).For over three months since April, the dollar has declined against other reserve currencies. Some investors believe that the fall in the value of the dollar has affected the price of Bitcoin. Prominent cryptocurrency trader Scott Melker said:“This is arguably the most pivotal moment we have seen for the United States Dollar since it bottomed in 2008. This channel has been intact for over 10 years. If it breaks down, hide yo' kids and buy a metric ton of Bitcoin.”The U.S. dollar tests the lower end of a 12-year trendline. Source: Scott MelkerIn recent weeks, as BTC rose to as high as $12,000, investors pointed at the declining dollar. Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx, said a depreciating dollar raises the chances of a BTC rally. The value of the dollar affects Bitcoin because traders typically price BTC against it. When the dollar depreciates, the asset that BTC is trading against is lower in value. Hence, when the dollar drops, it might increase the likelihood of BTC upside. Hao said:“If the dollar continues to depreciate, there is a high probability that Bitcoin will continue to rise.”Mark Wilcox, a Bitcoin analyst, raised a similar point. He pinpointed the biggest monthly drop of the dollar as the driving factor of BTC in the past several months. Wilcox explained that rather than Bitcoin increasing in value, it is the dollar that actually declined in price. He said, “bitcoin didn't go up, the dollar went down,” referring to the U.S. dollar index.The U.S. dollar index since 2010. Source: FT, Bloomberg, Mark WilcoxAnalysts say the dollar has been declining relative to other reserve currencies due to the slowing U.S. economy. The U.S. has the highest number of coronavirus cases, which is causing the rate of economic growth to slow down.“The thing that’s changed in the last few days is that it’s not just gold which has gone up against the dollar, but almost everything,” explained Société Générale’s global macro strategist Kit Juckes in a note. “That’s partly driven by a sense that the U.S. is having a harder time controlling the virus than others, which will see the U.S. economy underperform.”Traders are seemingly cautiously optimistic about the near-term trend of Bitcoin. At the same time, Bitcoin trading activity is reaching new highs in various markets, including institutional venues such as the CME and its BTC futures contracts.In recent weeks, the open interest of the CME Bitcoin futures market has risen to an all-time high. It indicates higher activity from accredited and institutional investors.

If Satoshi was still around, he would have a grin on his face. The landscape literally couldn't be better for Bitcoin.”The confluence of an unstable dollar and the rapidly increasing demand for gold could both fuel the momentum of BTC in the short term.Wall Street veteran Max Keiser, for example, predicted last week that Bitcoin is destined to continue beyond its all-time highs this year, possibly hitting as high as $28,000 before seeing a market correction."
114,"The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), is not going away once the ongoing financial crisis subsides, United States Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN) believes.A known industry advocate, Emmer says that Bitcoin will only be getting stronger after the world eventually emerges from the economic chaos caused by the coronavirus.“As we come out of the crisis, Bitcoin ain’t going away, it’s gonna get stronger,” the Congressman saod during an Aug. 3 interview with co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital Anthony Pompliano.According to Emmer, both Bitcoin and its underlying technology of blockchain will “continue to become more and more important” and see further advancements due to its unprecedented value. “You just watch, it has value, when something has value, people are going to take risks and it’s going to advance,” the politician said.According to Emmer, Bitcoin’s future is now even more promising after U.S. regulators authorized banks to provide custody for cryptocurrencies last week. As reported, the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency officially approved federally chartered banks to store crypto like Bitcoin on July 22. According to Emmer, Brian Brooks, Acting Comptroller of the Currency at the OCC, made a significant contribution to the future of Bitcoin:“And now Brian Brooks is saying ‘Hey, institutions, you can start banking this stuff. You can provide a home for it, you can start working with it.'”Representative Emmer is known for advocating cryptocurrency-powered innovation. Earlier this year, he expressed concerns about regulation smothering innovation. Previously, the Congressman has called on the government to provide more regulatory clarity for the crypto industry.Emmer is not alone in thinking that Bitcoin will become even more solid once markets start to recover. In March 2020, billionaire investor and blockchain tech supporter Tim Draper predicted that Bitcoin will be one of the most crucial tools for recovering from the global financial crisis. “When the world comes back, it will be Bitcoin, not banks and governments that save the day,” Draper said."

116,"Cybersecurity firm McAfee released a study showing the activities of NetWalker, a ransomware first known as Mailto that was initially discovered in August 2019.According to the report, the operators of NetWalker have collected over $25 million from ransom payments since March 2020.From March 1 to July 27, the group collected around 2,795 Bitcoin (BTC), purportedly making it one of the most profitable types of ransomware for cybercriminals.According to the report, the Bitcoin transactions received by the gang — where the amount is split among several different addresses — reflects that NetWalker is a ""ransomware-as-a-service"" malware.Such a maneuver implies that it has generated such a huge amount of money thanks to the affiliate revenue sharing it offers to other operators, McAfee states.McAfee notes that NetWalker operators have moved away from using legacy Bitcoin addresses to SegWit addresses, due to its faster transaction times and lower costs, suggesting a sophistication in their modus operandi after becoming a ransomware-as-a-service model.On March 20, at least two darknet forums saw posts related to the NetWalker actors offering the ransomware with a revenue-sharing scheme to help spread the malware and make it much as profitable as possible. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Brett Callow, threat analyst at malware lab Emsisoft, said:""NetWalker is a big game hunter and responsible for numerous attacks on larger public sector organizations as well as private sector companies. Working out the amount ransomware groups make is exceptionally difficult and, as McAfee states, the figure of $25 million is almost certainly an underestimate. Globally, companies paid more than $25 billion in ransom demands in 2019.""The study adds that most of the NetWalker's targets were based in western European countries and in the United States. The group had previously announced that they won’t target hospitals due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although there have been reports to the contrary.Crozer-Keystone Health System suffered a ransomware attack by the NetWalker ransomware on June 19. The attackers started to auction the system’s stolen data through its darknet website."

The AFP stated French authorities have accused Vinnik of defrauding more than 100 people out of $160 million between 2016 and 2018.Vinnik, also known as ""Mr. Bitcoin,"" is accused of laundering 300,000 Bitcoin (BTC) — roughly $3.4 billion at press time — over the course of six years through crypto exchange BTC-e.

119,"The Ethereum Foundation will be building a dedicated security team for Ethereum 2.0 to study any potential cybersecurity and crypto-economic issues in the next generation of the Ethereum network.Justin Drake, an Eth 2.0 researcher at the foundation, announced the start of the recruitment process on his Twitter feed.The foundation is looking to hire a variety of security and auditing professionals, both for the software and the general model of the upcoming upgrade.Among the potential team’s tasks will be “fuzzing, bounty hunting, pager duty,” which directly relates to software security management. Ethereum client developers have already engaged in fuzzing for the upcoming Eth 2.0 clients. The efforts were spearheaded by Sigma Prime, the developers of the Rust-based Lighthouse client.Fuzzing is a bug searching technique that involves feeding garbage data to software in order to trigger a non-standard response. Many of the bugs found today in the web are due to improper input sanitation, where special types of inputs may be interpreted as machine code or simply produce undesired behavior. Fuzzing helps find these critical points and update the code to prevent potentially catastrophic bugs.The security team will also be doing more theoretical work on formal verification of cryptographic algorithms. This process will seek to mathematically prove that a certain algorithm is secure. Economic modeling experts are also sought by the foundation.With the final stages of preparation for Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 underway, heavy emphasis is now being placed on the network’s security.Recently, the foundation launched specialized “attack networks” for bounty hunters to break. By finding issues before the mainnet launch, developers are looking to ensure a smooth transition. This approach has proven to be successful, with several confirmed exploits being patched. A multi-client attack net has been launched today following the program’s success.The Ethereum Medalla testnet, the first to be fully maintained by the community, is due for launch on Tuesday after locking in the required number of validators ahead of deadline.Mainnet launch will follow at an unspecified date when developers feel confident with the network’s stability. Drake anticipated earlier that this may only happen in 2021, though some, like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, are more optimistic for a launch this year."

In that scenario, according to Paul, we’ll enter a period of hyperinflation similar to the Great Inflation of the 1970s. During such an event, investors could move their wealth away from dollars and Treasury bonds into inflation-resistant assets.“If we have a return to something like the 1970s, I think probably gold rallies five to 10 times or more, I think Bitcoin probably rallies 10 to 30 times or more,” he claimed. Paul believes this process has already started and that we are already in an “inflationary market, a Bitcoin bull market and gold bull market in the early stages.”He also said “Bitcoin is like a call on inflation,” meaning that as long as the expectation of high inflation remains high, the price of the call (Bitcoin) will also increase.

124,"The price of Bitcoin declined by more than 13% within 30 minutes on Aug. 2. The shocking short-term price action caused $1 billion worth of liquidations in futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH). Following the rapid sell-off, traders are cautiously optimistic and are considering both bullish and bearish scenarios.Before delving into the various scenarios traders have in mind for Bitcoin, it is crucial to understand what caused the correction. On-chain data from Santiment suggests that warning signs emerged when the growth of daily active addresses slumped as Bitcoin topped at around $12,000. The number of active addresses is considered a key fundamental factor for BTC because it reflects Bitcoin’s network activity. Shortly after the price of BTC superseded the trend of active addresses, it fell rapidly. Santiment explained that “daily active addresses on the network were not keeping up with the surging price,” suggesting a swift correction.The sudden price drop also coincided with BTC hitting a historically relevant resistance level of $12,000. The $11,500–$12,000 range has served as a hard resistance zone for over two years, since 2018. Every attempt to break out of the range has led to a prolonged correction.The last attempt at a breakout over $12,000 was in June 2019. Although the price of Bitcoin eventually reached a peak of $13,880 on BitMEX, it dropped to $7,700 within three months. If BTC surpasses $12,000, there is little resistance to $14,000 and ultimately to its record-high at $20,000. As such, sellers will likely aggressively defend the $12,000 level, causing pullbacks.However, it seems that crypto market traders are overall optimistic about the medium-term price trend of BTC. Data from Binance Futures shows that the majority of “top traders” on the platform are currently longing BTC.While the price of Bitcoin dropped to as low as $10,546 on Coinbase, traders say that the market structure of BTC remains compelling. Crypto trader Koroush AK outlined Bitcoin’s strong recovery from the $10,800 support level after the drop as $1 billion of long contracts were liquidated. He said: “Even with the crash over the weekend, $BTC still looks bullish.”After mass liquidations, some traders suggest that the market will shake off “weak hands,” leading to Bitcoin cooling off and funding rates stabilizing, with the entire cycle potentially strengthening its momentum. Funding rates refer to the amount in fees that long-contract or short-contract holders on Bitcoin futures exchanges have to pay. When the market is mostly long, holders of long contracts have to pay a fee to short-contract holders, and vice versa when the market is mostly short.Prior to the drop, the funding rates of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, rose to unsustainable rates, with Ether seeing its funding rate climb to 0.15% at one point. If a trader opens a long contract worth $50,000, a 0.15% funding rate would result in $225 per day in funding fees to maintain.A pseudonymous trader known as “Redxbt” pointed out that there was approximately $77 million worth of bids on BitMEX after the drop. This suggests that BTC is still technically in an uptrend and that buyers are protecting the $10,500 support level: “Bull market tings — 77 million in bids hugging price. Perhaps they’re preparing for a very rare event, March 12th tier, to get some fills?”Subsequent to the short-term correction, cryptocurrency trader Scott Melker said a potential hidden bullish divergence is building. Prior to the fall of BTC, Melker emphasized that there were glaring bearish divergences and that a retrace was imminent. But a bullish divergence emerges when an asset falls to a local low but an oscillator does not drop to a new low. It suggests that the momentum of the asset is intact despite recent price drops. Melker explained:“It was building bear divs on multiple time frames, a retrace was inevitable. Now there’s potential hidden bullish divergence brewing, not yet confirmed. Price dropped with $15 of the previous major swing high, which was the line that signified a bullish break in structure.”The overall sentiment remains optimistic around Bitcoin, but there are several bearish scenarios that can play out. Generally, most short-term bearish arguments revolve around the $10,500 support level. If BTC fails to remain above $10,500, it could hint at discontinuation of the rally.The $10,500 level is considered to be an important support area because it marks the top of the previous rally. In February, the price of Bitcoin peaked at $10,550, establishing it as a strong resistance level. When BTC surpassed $10,500, it confirmed the level as a support area for a new range. Bitcoin trader Zoran Kole, who remains bullish, offered a bearish scenario:“As far as invalidation, I think ~10.5 is the weekly level to hold for continuation. Otherwise this distribution schematic becomes rather compelling. Remember, trading is a binary decision tree. Changes in bias should occur near potential inflection points.”Similarly, using a different technical analysis system called Ichimoku cloud, cryptocurrency analyst Josh Olszewicz suggested a break below $10,550 could lead to discontinuation. In the near term, Olszewicz said $10,559 and $10,832 would act as important support levels. He shared on Twitter: “best we avoid this zone down here if we want decent continuation in near term. already had the kijun bounce.”According to Elias Simos, senior research analyst at Decentral Park Capital, Bitcoin sold-off when it matched the relative performance of gold. He explained that the sell-off coincided with the point that would have made BTC outperform the precious metal, and its potential correlation with gold could affect it in the weeks ahead.A pseudonymous trader called “Rookie” foresees cryptocurrencies with low to medium market capitalizations underperforming against BTC in the future. If that happens, it raises the probability of BTC seeing profit-taking rallies, which might strengthen its momentum:“I’m drastically reducing my exposure to low – med cap alt plays. The move is, and always has been to have as much $BTC and $ETH exposure for now. I don’t want to have money trapped in some low liquidity shit coin when / if things start going parabolic.”The confluence of a historically challenging resistance level for BTC at $12,000 and high funding rates make for strong bearish scenarios. But bullish divergences, lack of resistance from $12,000 to $14,000 and a recent flush of over-leveraged futures contacts strengthen the argument for a prolonged uptrend."
125,"Amid a major bullish trend on cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) market capitalization is outstripping some major publicly traded companies like Intel and Coca-Cola.Following a bullish market in late July 2020, Bitcoin’s market cap saw a significant increase to cross a $200 billion threshold. As of press time, the market cap of the largest cryptocurrency accounts for more than $207 billion, down from a $222 billion intraday-high recorded earlier today, according to data from Coin360.As such, Bitcoin is currently worth more than shares of major global companies like Intel and Coca-Cola in terms of market capitalization. On July 31, shares of Intel and Coca-Cola closed at a market cap of $203 billion and $202 billion, respectively, according to data from Macro Trends.Bitcoin seven-day market cap chart. Source: Coin360A major global tech company, Intel saw a notable decline in market share in recent days. After Intel posted disappointing Q3 earnings guidance on July 22, the company’s market cap dropped below $259 billion to subsequently lose as much as $45 billion by July 24, according to data from Macro Trends.Intel all-time market cap chart. Source: Macro TrendsThis is not the first time when Intel was left trailing behind Bitcoin by market capitalization though. Over the course of 2017, Intel’s market cap did not go higher than $220 billion, while Bitcoin’s market cap crossed a $300 billion threshold in its historic bullish run of 2017, when BTC hit its all-time high of $20,000.Amid coronavirus-fueled uncertainty, beverage giant Coca-Cola suffered a major sell off earlier this year. In March 2020, Coca-Cola lost more than $90 billion in market cap over the course of one month as a consequence of the global pandemic. The drop eventually resulted in the company’s largest decline in quarterly revenue in at least 30 years, as reported last week.In contrast, Bitcoin has been seeing multiple bullish moves this year, up more than $80 billion, or about 40%, in market cap since Jan. 1, 2020. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has recently touched its new 2020 highs, crossing the $12,000 price mark on Aug. 2."
126,"A recent report by crypto derivatives platform, Zubr, found that despite being extremely volatile when compared to traditional asset classes, Bitcoin (BTC) maintains a “market equilibrium” nature for the majority of the time.The report just a few days after Bitcoin rallied beyond the $12,000 mark and its volatility finally recovered from a multi-year low.Using data from CoinAPI, a cryptocurrency market data provider, Zubr found that Bitcoin price swings are typically accompanied by nearly symmetrical movements on the opposite side, creating opportunities both on the positive and negative side. According to Zubr:“The majority of the time, Bitcoin will almost mimic the exact percentage increase with a percentage decrease on the very same day.“Bitcoin: Daily % Change from Open-to-High and from Open-to-Low. Source: ZubrTypically, this mirror effect takes place within the same trading day, but Zubr also found that it can also occur over the course of longer time periods. This means that over the short term, Bitcoin’s recent rally to $12,000 could see a similar return to the $10,000 levels and a number of  other factors pointing to the possibility of this pullback. Developing better awareness of market equilibrium and its relation to Bitcoin price can be extremely insightful when incorporated into a day-trading strategy, especially considering that the volatility phenomenon discussed earlier has been constant since 2017. Traders can ride the volatility and gain from both shorting and longing Bitcoin on a daily basis. However, this is only one of the many things traders should have in mind. According to Zubr:“What the data is effectively indicating is lower risk opportunities are possible if one is to trust the historical events and deem such swing intrinsic to Bitcoin’s trading character. For example, should Bitcoin increase by 10% and retreat back to its opening price, history indicates that there is an overwhelming chance (over 50%) that the price drops between 9-12% within the same day or following day.“While inconclusive on its own, this data point can be used when composing a strategy for intraday and momentum trading styles. In the meantime, only time will tell if Bitcoin will maintain its current market equilibrium or continue higher above the $12K mark."
127,"Bitcoin (BTC) begins a new week at over $11,000 after a wild weekend saw the market crash $1,200 in minutes — will the chaos continue?Cointelegraph gives you five factors that could easily impact Bitcoin price action over the coming days. More than usual, this week looks set to be big in terms of Bitcoin-specific market phenomena. In recent months, there have been macro factors that dictate general price trajectory, with BTC/USD showing a strong correlation to stock markets in particular. After two weeks of much more volatile activity, however, Bitcoin has decidedly divorced itself from the action in stocks. Analysts’ attention is now turning to Bitcoin’s own derivatives traders.On Monday, CME Group’s Bitcoin futures opened noticeably lower than where they left off last Friday. The resulting “gap” in the market — between $11,450 and $11,600 — may well form a short-term price target.As Cointelegraph often reports, Bitcoin has a tendency to rise or fall to “fill” CME futures gaps. Other than this weekend, however, another gap remains unfilled, this time much lower — between $9,660 and $9,930.For Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, the area $1,000 above the lower gap was now necessary to hold as support — $10,800.“If we lose that support, then most likely I’m going to target the support we had previously which is the area around $10,000, which is also the CME gap,” he summarized in a new video update. CME Bitcoin futures chart showing two gaps. Source: TradingViewAt press time, with stock markets slowly opening up to relatively flat conditions, BTC/USD was yet to target new levels after sticking to $11,200 over the past 24 hours.Changes in global economic sentiment still have considerable sway over Bitcoin investment. This week, attention will focus on the heat between the United States and China, along with fresh coronavirus stimulus measures from Washington. The situation is precarious — Bitcoin’s rise over the past few weeks has come as the dollar sees a protracted fall. At the same time, investors have rushed into safe havens such as gold and silver.Continued USD weakness may come to form a new bullish signal for Bitcoin price action, whether or not it is merely a function of coronavirus response.“The currency bet is mainly a bet on relative control of the virus, not reflecting the fundamental strength of the economies in question,” Stephen Jen, CEO of United Kingdom macro investment firm Eurizon SLJ Capital, told Bloomberg.One news story which may have much broader implications than merely social and political is U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to ban Chinese social media platform TikTok.The video-based platform has become the target of increasing conflict between Beijing and Washington, with Trump citing national security concerns due to its operations.On Sunday, Cointelegraph reported on why banishing TikTok could impact cryptocurrency markets. The platform’s power has already been aptly demonstrated — a user-led publicity campaign to revive the fortunes of meme-based altcoin Dogecoin (DOGE) delivered huge gains within a matter of days. Gold sentiment may act as a precursor to any changes in Bitcoin’s progress. The precious metal remains at all-time highs in USD terms, on track to pass the psychologically significant $2,000 mark.“Gold has risen 8 weeks in a row, finishing with its highest monthly close ever. Silver is also up 8 weeks in a row, with its highest monthly close since April 2013,” gold bug Peter Schiff summarized on Friday, adding: “The U.S. Dollar Index has now fallen for 6 consecutive weeks, with the lowest monthly close since April 2018.”Last week, Citigroup analysts were less bullish on XAU/USD, giving the chances of $2,000 appearing by the end of the year as 30%.At press time, $1,973 suggested that investors may not have to wait so long.XAU/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewHitting $12,000 over the weekend has nonetheless placed Bitcoin back in mainstream consciousness. Altcoins’ successes, particularly those of Ether (ETH), have added to press interest.“People are trying to jump on momentum. The entire crypto market is a microcosm of everything happening in stocks,” analyst Mati Greenspan summarized to the Wall Street Journal.Responding, Bill Barhydt, CEO of payment company Abra, revealed that consumer interest in cryptocurrency more broadly had definitively changed.“Consumer interest in Bitcoin is definitely growing now,” he tweeted, adding:  “Abra has seen record deposit volume since we launched our Abra Interest Account last week.  I've heard similar feedback from others.”As Cointelegraph reported last week, data from Google Trends confirmed that price volatility had sparked a surge in search activity for both Bitcoin and gold.

Source: SkewBack on derivatives markets, meanwhile, growing open interest and volume for Bitcoin options suggests that institutional investors remain firmly interested in short-term and mid-term profitability. Bitcoin is still tussling with altcoins in terms of profitability, with Ether continuing to crush long-term resistance on multiple timeframes.Late July saw altcoins front-run BTC to the delight of investors, led by ETH/USD as trading of ERC-20 DeFi tokens exploded.Ether reached $400 over the weekend, falling to $364 before maintaining its highest levels since August 2018.

The “make it or break it level” for now, he concluded, remains at $11,500."
128,"Major investment banking company Goldman Sachs says the price of gold will rise 20% to reach $2,300 before the end of 2022.The commodity hit new record highs on July 31 at more than $2,000 per ounce, but Goldman believes it still has a long way to go. According to a report cited by Bloomberg, the bank believes the price of gold will surge to $2,300 in the next 12 months — a revised forecast that originally predicted $2,000 — due to concerns over the US dollar’s standing.Analysts at Goldman Sachs stated on July 28 that a “record level of debt accumulation” from the U.S. government and “real concerns around the longevity of the US dollar as a reserve currency” had affected the price of the commodity. Gold is currently priced at $1,975 per ounce.Goldman said the measures taken by the U.S. government to lessen the economic impact caused by the pandemic — for example, stimulus payments — could easily lead to a rise in debt through currency debasement. The bank stated that such conditions would boost prices in gold and silver.However, many other alternatives to fiat currency would look more attractive to investors as the U.S. dollar slowly loses its value as a reserve currency. Cointelegraph reported on July 30 that Bitcoin (BTC) could be a better hedge against inflation than gold. Since March, the cryptocurrency has had a stronger negative correlation with the dollar than gold."
129,"Multinational tech company Garmin may have paid some or all of a $10 million crypto ransom to hackers who managed to encrypt the firm’s internal network and take down several of its services on July 23.According to an August 1 report from Lawrence Abrams at Bleeping Computer, Garmin’s IT department used a decryptor to regain access to workstations affected by the initial WastedLocker ransomware attack. The malware took down the company’s customer support, navigation solutions, and other online services. The news outlet reported that the existence of such a protocol means “Garmin must have paid the ransom to the attackers” as the malware used in the hack has “no known weaknesses in their encryption algorithm.” “Garmin's script contains a timestamp of '07/25/2020', which indicates that the ransom was paid either on July 24 or July 25,” stated the report.Cointelegraph reported on July 27 that Russian cybergang Evil Corp was responsible for extorting a $10 million crypto ransom from Garmin following the ransomware attack.Maksim Yakubets, the leader of the cybercriminal group, had previously been indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2019. He was also listed on the FBI’s Most Wanted list with a reward set at $5 million – the highest amount offered by authorities for the arrest of a cybercriminal.The technology firm’s most recent tweet on July 27 stated that “many of the systems and services affected by the recent outage, including Garmin Connect, are returning to operation.” An update on the company’s website states Garmin was the “victim of a cyber attack,” but makes no references to any ransom. Because Evil Corp was officially sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2019, Garmin could face sanctions for admitting it sent any funds to the group. Emisoft threat analyst Brett Callow previously told Cointelegraph that such a payment would “create a legal minefield.” “Payment may be the only way for a company to avoid a catastrophic loss of data,” said Callow. “But it may be illegal for the company to make that payment.”Other companies targeted by ransomware groups have ended up paying millions in crypto ransom demands rather than risk losing business while computer access is restored or sensitive information is released. U.S.-based travel firm CWT negotiated with ransomware hackers, haggling on the price of a ransom over a malware attack down from $10 million to $4.5 million in Bitcoin (BTC). The University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine also reportedly paid more than $1 million in crypto as part of a ransom for a June 1 hack.Cointelegraph reached out to Garmin for comment, but received no reply as of press time."
130,"Digital assets, as a new asset class, exhibit interesting characteristics that could benefit a diversified portfolio of traditional assets. There are, however, many ways to get exposed to digital assets — passive investment, actively managed, short or long term investing, etc. — and with over 800 funds of all sizes, ranging from passive index to active trading funds to venture capital funds and fund of funds, it can be hard to sort the wheat from the chaff.Just like hedge funds, crypto funds come in all shapes and sizes, and investors tend to look at them through their usual hedge-fund analysis prism. However, as crypto funds deal with a new asset class that has unique characteristics — digital assets — investors can be led to misleading conclusions when traditional asset metrics are used.The purpose of this article is to provide a quantitative analysis framework to get a first sense of a crypto fund. This is a simple set of tools that helps to understand the potential risk and possible upside of a crypto fund, but no investment decision should be only made on them. One may use these tools to screen a list of crypto funds from a database and extract a short-list to be reviewed in-depth or to assess more precisely a selected crypto fund.Short-listed funds should then be assessed for their noninvestment strategy aspects — i.e., their operations, their team, their service providers, etc. — which are out of the scope of this article. Also, please note that this is not the de facto method to analyze funds, but only one that has proven its robustness over time. Passive index funds. These funds provide passive exposure to a single or a basket of digital assets in an easily investible format — fund or certificate — where the value is linked to the underlying minus fees. Most of such funds will hold the physical assets (such as Grayscale Investments), but others provide the exposure — essentially, to Bitcoin (BTC) — through futures contracts, which are derivative instruments linked to the value of the physical digital assets. They deliver the performance of the underlying asset held, and typically have higher daily-to-weekly liquidity and lower fees.Initial coin offering/venture capital funds. These funds invest essentially in early-stage companies via the detention of company-emitted tokens instead of traditional shares of the company but without equity ownership and right to future dividends. These funds are not different from traditional venture capital funds: They invest in a basket of promising projects and look to resell their ownership when the projects have matured, splitting their investment risk on various projects instead of just an “all-or-nothing” strategy. Their liquidity terms for investors tend to be better than traditional VC funds/private equity firms, but they are still highly dependent on the liquidity of the underlyings.Active trading funds. This category can be split into two sub-categories: (1) market-making/market-neutral funds that provide exchanges liquidity; and (2) directional-trading funds. Funds from the first sub-category tend to deliver a steady performance by sharing the profits they make by acting as the counterparty to traders on exchanges charging a small fee for their service; whereas funds from the second sub-category tend to deliver a more volatile performance than the market-neutral funds but in exchange of a generally much higher performance over the mid-to-long term.Market-making/market-neutral funds tend to be fully automated due to the very large amount of trades taken in a short period of time, but directional trading funds can be either discretionary — i.e., investment decisions are human-based — or systematic where investment decisions result of a human-designed model but executed by a computer for the best efficiency.For an investor simply looking to get exposure to a hard-to-store asset such as digital assets, a fund providing passive exposure is the best option as long as the fund custodies the physical digital assets and could provide “in-kind” redemptions — i.e., the fund could return the investors’ money in the form of physical digital assets, as well as in equivalent fiat currency.Funds that provide passive exposure to digital assets through futures are the worst option. Because futures have to be “rolled” on a regular basis, extra costs are incurred, including trading costs, execution slippage and “roll” costs, which can be seen as extra management fees, eating the investors’ investment value over time independently of the underlying returns. Moreover, since such funds don’t hold any physical asset, they cannot deliver them “in-kind” directly; if they provide the option, that would come at an extra cost to the investor, as the fund would have to purchase the physical digital assets on the market in order to deliver them to the investor — for a value less than their market value when all purchasing costs are accounted for.Investing in such funds is very difficult, as no one has a crystal ball to predict what early-stage projects are going to be the next unicorn. Investors can only rely on the experience of the fund management team in selecting projects and their means to strengthen and develop them. Picking up the next unicorn could lead to an astronomic return on investment, but it will take time.Investing in such funds can provide uncorrelated returns versus the broad market, but during global bear markets, the valuation of these projects tends to fall as well, and so does the value of the funds.Funds that are neither passive index nor VC funds can be considered active trading funds. It is mandatory, first of all, to have a fundamental understanding of the management investment strategy: Will it be more market-making/market-neutral or directional? Long/cash or long/short? Systematic or discretionary? What universe of instruments are traded? And so on. This sheds light on the general framework of the fund.Market-neutral funds tend to exhibit a steady performance — i.e., low volatility and low drawdowns — but can appear very remote from the digital assets returns, whereas directional funds tend to exhibit a higher return but at the price of higher volatility and deeper drawdowns.Market-neutral funds are generally easier to assess than directional funds, as their performance is expected to be as steady as possible: the steadier, the better.However, before investing in a market-neutral fund that exhibits the highest expected performance among its peers, given an acceptable level of returns steadiness, the investor has to understand what could possibly go wrong with the fund strategy. For a market-making high-frequency trading fund, it could be an IT issue or some dislocation in the broad market, leading to very large spreads impacting the market-making algorithm (see the notorious 2010 flash crash).Since their performance is generally much lower than directional funds but are much steadier, an investor can be tempted to leverage investments in such vehicles. However, the investor has to keep in mind that there is no guarantee of steady returns, and leveraging several times such funds could lead to an unexpected, drastic loss should something go wrong. Indeed, even if market-neutral funds exhibit a very low net exposure, it doesn’t mean that they have a very low gross exposure; they can be levered on the long and the short side many times, which may lead to a very sudden, huge loss (see 2007 Quant Quake for a more academic analysis).Directional funds, contrary to their market-neutral cousins, try to capture market moves being either long (during market up-moves) or short (during market down-moves) for funds having the ability to play both sides of the market (long/short funds), whereas the long/cash funds will try to only capture market up-moves while remaining in cash during downward market moves.Directional funds are much more volatile than market-neutral funds, and their drawdowns could be significant, especially with cryptocurrencies.Assessing a discretionary, human-managed fund is harder than assessing a systematically computer-driven fund.Past track record. The past live track record of a discretionary fund may not reflect its future performance, as the fund manager took some trading decisions along the way according to the market environment back then and may not take similar decisions going forward. However, a systematic fund implements a set of trading rules applied by a computer, guaranteeing that the output will always follow the same investment process as far as the fund manager doesn’t change the model nor override the model decisions.Backtest. The backtest of a fund is a simulation of the trading rules as if they had been applied in the past. For obvious reasons, a backtest is inherent to systematic funds as the investment process has to always be the same. Despite all of the caveats of a backtest (like any simulation), if it has been established under reasonable hypotheses, it can give some insights about the expected performance of the manager going forward. Detailing all of the potential caveats and how to estimate the value of a backtest is beyond the scope of this article, but one quick check that can be done is to compare the backtested results vs. the realized results over the same period. The more in-synch the two track records are, the more robust and insightful the backtest. However, if the two track records diverge, some questioning of the manager prevails.24/7 markets. Crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in contrast to traditional asset markets, which are open only a few hours a day and not on weekends. Therefore, a crypto fund manager must always be on the lookout, as swift moves can occur without much notice at any time during the day — much like how Bitcoin lost 50% of its value in less than two hours on March 12, 2020. So, only the most reactive investment strategies will be able to trade.Therefore, a discretionary directional trading crypto fund has to be managed by a team of at least three portfolio managers relying on each other every eight hours to monitor the markets and trading accordingly, as well as a couple of extra portfolio managers as substitutions for the main ones, but nothing guarantees that the different portfolio managers would react the same in a given situation. On the other hand, a systematic computer-driven fund, if properly designed with strong oversight and risk-management processes, can run 24/7 and be simply monitored by a small team. This is why most of the directional trading crypto funds are systematic and computer-driven.This is part one of a two-part series on how to sort crypto funds — read part two on how to analyze actively trading crypto funds with some useful metrics to assess their true risk here.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

131,"Coming every Sunday, Hodler’s Digest will help you track every single important news story that happened this week. The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.Bitcoin rallies 13% to break through $11,000After weeks of stagnation, Bitcoin finally roared to life this week. Late on Monday, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency surged to a new 2020 high of $11,394. The bull run meant almost 95% of Bitcoin’s supply was in profit. Bloomberg released a mid-year report predicting BTC could soon rise above $12,000, with on-chain and off-chain indicators suggesting that the asset will appreciate. Indeed, hodlers didn’t have to wait long for the next surge. As the weekend began, BTC surpassed $11,600 for the first time in 12 months, prompting some investors to believe there would be little resistance until $15,000. There was further excitement as Bitcoin surged even further to $12,000 — but unfortunately for the bulls, the market drama was far from over. On Sunday, Bitcoin plunged by 13% within minutes, taking it as low as $10,550. Low trading volumes on weekends and a market that was heavily swayed to longs or buyers might have been to blame for the sudden cascade in liquidations. With the Fear and Greed Index hitting a score of 80 — indicating “Extreme Greed” — the question now is whether the crypto world needs to brace itself for a larger pullback.Three reasons why Ethereum price rallied 75% to hit a two-year high at $400The other big story has been Ether’s extraordinary march from $225 to $400 in the space of two weeks, coinciding with its fifth anniversary. Many investors believe ETH’s momentum has been buoying the entire market — and possibly even pushing BTC upwards. Three factors appear to be triggering the strong rally: decentralized finance, the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade and the prolonged rally in the altcoin market. With Ether reaching two-year highs, some crypto traders have warned that a pullback may be on the horizon. Edward Morra said: “Yeah, parabola coming out of another parabola is a sight to behold tbh. Also, this isn’t sustainable and will correct. If you are new to this space — buy dips, don’t FOMO at the top.” According to the market data aggregator Messari, Ether is now the best-performing asset class of 2020. However, there could be some clouds on the horizon. Kosala Hemachandra, the founder of MyEtherWallet, has told Cointelegraph that the fully-fledged version of Ethereum 2.0 could be years away after suffering repeated delays.XRP is up 30% and has 30 new whalesBitcoin and Ether aren’t the only digital assets posting outsized gains. Just look at XRP, which has managed to reclaim its position as the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. Its value has risen by 32.74% in the past week — that’s more than BTC and ETH put together. The number of accounts holding more than 1 million XRP (about $287,000 at the time of writing) has increased by 3.7%, with 30 new whales appearing over the last two weeks. There’s no obvious reason behind the recent increase in whales except for speculation. Despite XRP leapfrogging Tether in the rankings, it is worth remembering that Ripple is also the currency in court facing a class-action lawsuit from investors.U.S. printed more money in one month than in two centuriesNow here’s a stunning statistic: The U.S. printed more money in June than in the first two centuries after its founding. That’s according to Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead, who has been looking into the levels of quantitative easing that the Federal Reserve has deployed to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to investors, he said: “[In June] the U.S. budget deficit — $864 billion — was larger than the total debt incurred from 1776 through the end of 1979.” Morehead made it clear that his company sees Bitcoin as a solution for the current crisis — and said the inflation caused by rampant QE as the main reason people should “get out of paper money and into Bitcoin.”A 17-year-old was just arrested in connection with Twitter’s recent hackIt’s emerged that a teenager is among those who have been taken into custody in relation to Twitter’s massive hack. The 17-year-old was arrested in Tampa, Florida, and has been accused of being the mastermind behind the biggest security and privacy breach in the social network’s history. The devastating exploit saw many top Twitter accounts breached on July 15 — including profiles belonging to Elon Musk, Joe Biden and Bill Gates. Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren said: “Make no mistake, this was not an ordinary 17-year-old. This was a highly sophisticated attack on a magnitude not seen before. It could have been an extremely high amount of loss.” Two others have been arrested. One of them is 19-year-old Briton Mason Sheppard, also known as “Chaewon.” The other is 22-year-old Nima Fazeli, who lives in Florida and is also known as “Rolex.”At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $11,077.55, Ether at $367.82 and XRP at $0.285.

It’s claimed Doki is a fully undetected backdoor that abuses the DOGE blockchain “in a unique way” to breach cloud servers. Intezer says that using Dogecoin to deploy a crypto-unrelated malware may be “quite resilient” to both law enforcement and security products. That’s why Doki has managed to stay undetected for over six months, despite having been uploaded to the VirusTotal database in January. The researchers added that such an attack is “very dangerous,” as it can take just a few hours to be infected by this campaign.Tokenized real estate hasn’t lived up to the hype, property researcher saysAs the initial coin offering boom subsided and the 2018 crypto bear trend began to set in, many analysts predicted that security tokens may drive the next market cycle. The vast capital locked in the real estate sector was eyed hungrily for tokenization — but with the industry’s attention focused on the Bitcoin halving, Ethereum 2.0 and DeFi, it appears tokenizing property is no longer the flavor of the month. Matthew McAuley, the director of global research at JLL, wrote in The Investor: “It’s been very slow going with blockchain in real estate, despite it being touted as a game-changer for a number of years now.” Despite properties being sold using crypto in 2017, with fractionalized ownership in a five-star resort being offered the following year, a lack of institutional appetite meant projects dried up in 2019. McAuley warned: “I find it difficult to believe blockchain will be as used, or as useful, in real estate as was thought initially.”Five years since launch, is Ethereum creating a new boom?The Ethereum network turned five years old this week.

After the sharp up move of the past few days, some short-term traders pressed the sell button as Bitcoin topped $12,000. This resulted in a massive drop in Bitcoin and several other altcoins, but the positive sign is that buyers emerged at lower levels, which suggests that traders who missed buying the breakout are keen to get in. The next few days are critical as they will provide deeper insight into whether Bitcoin has started a sustained up move or if this was a massive bull trap.Bitcoin (BTC) started an uptrend after it broke out of the $10,000–$10,400 resistance level on July 27.

The new move has put Bitcoin’s actual price at around double the realized price. On Black Thursday, the realized price was higher than the actual price.So how much higher will Bitcoin go? Max Keiser expects the coin to reach $28,000… then push on up into six figures. As for who’s been creating the demand, a study from Cornerstone Advisors has found that 80 percent of this year’s crypto buyers are men with an average income of $130,000. And it’s not just Bitcoin they’re buying, of course. As Bitcoin climbed, Ethereum leaped too, flying past its previous 2020 peak of $309.With cryptocurrencies on a roll, it’s no wonder that traditional traders are looking for a way in.

134,"Bitcoin has finally woken from its two-month slumber, as well as interest in the number-one cryptocurrency along with it. Bitcoin futures trading is bustling again, with both volume and aggregated interest at their highest since the March market crash. So, with all the action going on in Bitcoin (BTC), does this mean that the altcoin season is coming to an end? Maybe not.During a long period of inaction in Bitcoin, which saw traders growing bored and spot and derivatives trading on the decline, there was plenty of action going on in altcoins. Decentralized finance, in particular, is an area that has shown astonishing growth in 2020. In February, DeFi hit an important milestone by surpassing $1 billion in total locked value in its protocols. Today, despite the savage market conditions particularly in the first quarter, that figure has almost quadrupled. Total locked value in DeFi now stands at over $3.8 billion.DeFi tokens haven’t been the only ones seeing major price surges either, although they led the charge. Popular altcoin Dogecoin (DOGE) also saw massive gains on the back of the infamous viral TikTok video, and projects like Filecoin and Polkadot also caused a stir (and parabolic gains). All this happened while Bitcoin was languishing in the $9,000–$10,000 range, which resembled a stablecoin at times. The alt season had begun in earnest… but is it about to stop?Bitcoin made its biggest move this year when it pierced the resistance level of $10,500 and briefly shot past $11,400 on Monday. This was indeed accompanied by a price correction in most major altcoins, including some of the high-performance DeFi tokens like LINK, Maker (MKR), Compound Coin (COMP) and Aave (LEND) at the beginning of this week.The temporary retractions, as BTC made an epic breakout, seemed to suggest that traders may have been taking the gains made in these alts and placing them into Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). Let’s not forget, after all, that Ether, despite stalling a little in the last couple of days, has still posted gains of more than 40% this month.On Thursday, however, as BTC hovered around the $11,000 mark, indecisive of which way it wants to go next, many of the DeFi tokens made up for lost ground. Notably, Aave and Synthetix Network Token (SNX) registered 24-hour gains of 18.8% and 6.5%, respectively.While we can perhaps conclude that the altcoin season may have temporarily pressed pause while Bitcoin stole the limelight, let’s remember that most altcoins follow Bitcoin’s pattern and rise in price shortly after as well. BTC’s gains are good for altcoins, and the buzz surrounding DeFi cannot be ignored. Just as we’re seeing more and more locked value every day, we are also seeing major institutional investment in the DeFi space.Giant players like TD Ameritrade, CMT Digital and Arca Labs have all been investing in DeFi’s development and calling for regulatory clarification. We’ve even seen the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approve an Ethereum-based fund by Arca Labs earlier this month. Bitcoin’s dominance may still remain high at 61.4%, but the promise of DeFi, the expectations surrounding Ethereum 2.0 and its major gains this year all show more promise for alts.Moreover, with U.S. banks now being allowed to custody Bitcoin, a nod from the SEC at Ethereum, and no investor able to ignore the potential of DeFi, the signs look bullish for the space in general. And unlike the wild bull run of 2017, this time around, the industry is infinitely better prepared. The run won’t be simply retail-driven or fueled by fear of missing out, and the high-quality projects leading the charge have shown real progress and promise, as well as real products to back up their white papers.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Jay Hao is a tech veteran and seasoned industry leader.

135,"Yesterday saw many major altcoins rally to their yearly highs, with Ether (ETH) surging past $400, which I expected was a likely scenario in my last article two weeks ago.  In addition, XRP also had a bumper day exceeding $0.32 while momentarily outperforming Bitcoin as expected in my July 1 article. However, Bitcoin showed its dominance in the space by wiping out several billion of these gains in a little over an hour. So what does the week ahead look like, and just what sort of impact could Trump's TikTok ban have on the cryptocurrency space?Daily cryptocurrency market snapshot, Aug. 2. Source: Coin360.comBTC/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingView Bitcoin on the weekly shows a picture of the future. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has already tested the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level of $12K before being rejected.  If you haven’t been paying attention to the weekly fib, then you should probably google how to use the Fibonacci tool on Tradingview right now because it’s probably the closest you’ll ever get to having Marty McFly's sports almanac in Back to the Future 2 than you’ll ever get.  The next level to claim is 0.618, which sits at $13,500, and if you’re happy with 20% gains on Bitcoin, that’s great. But when you look at other top-tier alts, you will see that most are trading under the 0.236 fib, which means greater upside potential, and this is something we experienced this weekend. ETH/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingView Ether (ETH) exploded by 80% from the bottom of an ascending channel and already made a run at the 0.236 fib. Keep in the back of your mind that Bitcoin is currently on the 0.5 fib, or two levels higher than the 0.236, and ETH hasn’t even claimed that level yet.  Just wait until this level is broken and Ether makes a run-up to 0.382, that’s an ETH price of $660, and this is likely only the beginning.  The potential downside now sits around the top of the channel it broke out from, which is around $300-$330, and below here I would be looking at the center part of the channel of around $280.  Despite the fact levels have already been hit in a flash crash earlier this morning, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if they were reached again before the next leg up to $660.  XRP/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewIf you liked the ETH chart, you’ll probably understand why XRP rallied hard too.  XRP briefly broke out of the same ascending channel that Ether was in, only XRP still has a long way to go to the 0.236 fib. As a matter of fact, it has a monstrous 188% move to achieve in order to reach the $0.85c fib target.  So if you missed Bitcoin, and you missed Ether, there’s still a very good chance that the number three digital asset by market capitalization could provide insane gains from its current level.  The downside potential for XRP using the same channel levels as Ether sits at 24 cents for the middle channel and 19 cents for the lower target. Once again, the first level has already been tested in the flash crash, so whether we will see these levels again in the short term is unlikely considering the current fib targets.  But if you’re worried about FOMOing in at the top, there is another leading crypto that is yet to awake from its bear hibernation. EOS/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingView EOS hasn’t been getting much attention lately, and technically speaking, it’s looking like the next large-cap coin to make a big run-up to 0.236, which in the case of EOS is $6.50 and with the price just under $3, this could give you some impressive gains in the short term. Since EOS is yet to break out of its channel, it is only logical as other top tier alts start to rally in the shadow of Bitcoin, that traders and investors will start looking at charts trading at the bottom, just like I noticed with ETH and XRP, EOS is currently still trading in the lower part of its channel, not quite the bottom — the bottom is planted at $2.50 — but the risk vs. reward for EOS certainly looks appealing.  There are also other good reasons to be looking at EOS right now. Not only is Brock Pierce currently running for POTUS, which can only be a good thing for EOS, but parent company Block.one are targeting Gen Z users flocking from TikTok with their Voice Social Media platform. In a tweet on July 30, Pierce said: “Gen Z is mobilizing to stand up for their rights and privacy! Individuals can make a difference. EVERY VOICE HEARD” Pierce also cites an LA Times about popular TikTok stars leaving the platform amid privacy concerns. The early Bitcoin investor is known for betting on the right thing and the right time, and with President Trump hinting towards a ban on TikTok as early as tomorrow, there’s a hole in the U.S. market where 80 million users may be looking for alternatives. While this may put EOS in a good position for extra exposure, there are already other blockchain-based social media platforms that are focused on bringing new users to the crypto space.  Once such company has recently undergone a rebrand ahead of its launch this month, called Hyprr, which is U.S.-based and partnered with banking giant Wells Fargo for purportedly easy on and off-ramps into crypto, which puts it in prime position to take over TikToks U.S.-based market share.I contacted Hyprr CEO David Brieley about his position in the wake of the potential TikTok ban, where he told me that Gen Z consumes 5 billion hours of content per day via social media, which is twice that of millennials. If you consider that Steemit once occupied a $1.8 billion market cap largely based on speculation and millennial appeal, you can only imagine the positive impact a successful blockchain-based social media platform could have on the market if it took off like TikTok, and what better way than to do in the wake of such a massive controversial ban of one of fastest-growing viral platforms. If Bitcoin fails to hold the previous multi-year resistance of $10,500 as fresh support, I would expect the downside to be limited to the 0.382 fib of around $9,500. However it seems that the bulls are going to be in control for a little while.  If Bitcoin can push past and hold above $12K, then the next logical area of resistance is $13,500, which represents the 0.618 fib. However, with alts rallying, and the cyclical effect of low-cap alts flowing into top-tier alts, and then back into Bitcoin before starting all over again, I would expect the price of Bitcoin to remain quite flat over the next week.

136,"According to Heisenberg Capital founder and Keiser Report host Max Keiser, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) would soon rally to $28,000. He believes the all-time high of BTC at $20,000 likely won’t act as resistance.Keiser, who is an early investor in unicorn Kraken and $100-million-worth Bitstamp, said:“The $20,000 level for #Bitcoin won’t pose any resistance. We won’t see any resistance till $28,000. A brief pullback then the assault on $100,000 begins with renewed vigor.”In the past 12 days, the price of Bitcoin has increased from $9,200 to $12,000, marking the highest price in over a year. The cryptocurrency market is benefiting from the strong momentum of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s Ether.Throughout the Bitcoin rally in the past month, Keiser has continuously reaffirmed his position on the medium-term trend of BTC. He expects BTC to eventually surpass $28,000, and shoot for a new all-time high at six figures.In late July, when the price of Bitcoin first broke out of $11,000, Keiser said a six-figure BTC is likely. Since then, BTC has confirmed $10,400 as a key support level, maintaining its momentum. He said:“$28,000 is in play before we see a pullback - and then we’re heading to 6-figures.”But on Aug. 2, as Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin saw its first major pullback since mid-June. The price of BTC fell abruptly from $12,000 to $10,500 within 15 minutes, causing $1 billion to get liquidated across the entire market.The price of Bitcoin sees a sharp drop in a short period. Source: TradingView.comKeiser and other high-profile appear to be unfazed by the move and generally consider the price action as a shakeout. Both over-leveraged and low-leverage long contracts were flushed out in less than an hour, causing the market to cool off.Cryptocurrency trader Scott Melker said there were many bearish divergences prior to the drop occurred. After such a strong rally in a short period, the market seemingly needed to stabilize from an overheated rally. He said:“A $1700 BTC hourly candle (mostly in a few minutes) on extremely high volume, including a similar sell-off on ETH in the middle of the night? Cool. There were bear divs everywhere, as I mentioned.”In the short term, some traders expect major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, to demonstrate low volatility. Subsequent to a large price movement, BTC tends to establish a range and see a sideways action for several weeks.Michael van de Poppe, a trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said altcoins could benefit from a potential BTC sideways action. He said:“The most likely case is that we’ll have volatility on $BTC & $ETH as they determine their range. But over time (one week-two weeks) this will start to drop. What do you have to do? Yes, buy dips on altcoins. While everyone is focused on $BTC, your focus should be on alts.”While the short-term predictions of traders vary, many investors are seemingly positive about the medium-term trend heading into 2021. Various macro factors, such as a declining U.S. dollar and rising liquidity, could further boost BTC’s current momentum.PlanB, the well-known creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) Bitcoin price model, also reaffirmed that BTC is on track to reach $100,000. He said following its explosive rally, BTC is “perfectly on track” to reach six figures."
137,"On July 22, 2020, the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published a letter clarifying that national banks and federal savings associations can indeed take custody of cryptocurrency assets. In the letter, Bitcoin was also acknowledged as “the first widely-adopted cryptocurrency.” On the same date, VISA, one of the largest payment companies with access to over 61 million merchants globally, revealed plans to offer Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and XRP payments.These steps toward mainstream acceptance come at a fortuitous yet harrowing time for world economics. Unprecedented quantitative easing, a fiscal stimulus and private bailouts have all returned in a much larger form than they existed in 2008. This time, however, it has all come in response to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The Federal Reserve along with central banks around the world are responding to the current financial crisis with trillions of new monetary units, leading to trillions more in existing state debt. A sudden and exponential increase in a nation’s monetary supply usually leads to high levels of inflation and, eventually, a mass devaluation of the currency. And in these situations, a cryptocurrency such as BTC, which has a fixed number of units, mathematically guaranteed, holds a unique inflation-proof value for investors.One such investor, Paul Tudor Jones, a revered hedge fund manager, holds approximately 2% of his assets in BTC. He sees Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and rampant central bank currency creation, comparing the digital asset to gold in the financially troubled 1970s.Mike Novogratz, the chairman and CEO of Galaxy Digital — a diversified financial services firm focused on the digital asset, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industry — also sees the current financial crisis as an “amazing environment” for Bitcoin. On April 2, Novogratz told CNBC that he had seen hedge funds and high-net-worth investors buying Bitcoin for the first time. Positive sentiment was already on the rise in 2019 as Bitcoin’s price nearly doubled, outperforming traditional investments including gold and the S&P 500. The current crisis has increased this trend.Amid this economic downturn, Grayscale Investments has announced the strongest quarter in its history. Investments, 88% from institutional investors, hit a record high for Grayscale’s digital investment products, including Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, in the first quarter of 2020. The company has $2.2 billion in assets under management. Total investments into Grayscale crypto products in Q1 2020 amounted to $503.7 million, compared to about $1.07 billion per month over the last 12 months.Cryptocurrency hedge funds’ assets under management more than doubled in 2019, rising to more than $2 billion at the end of last year, according to a survey published on May 11 by Big Four audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and Elwood Asset Management Services published. Based on data from the largest global crypto hedge funds by assets under management, including crypto index funds and crypto venture capital funds, the crypto hedge fund industry is expected to grow significantly with the price of Bitcoin. According to the report: “Our Q1 2020 research shows that there are around 150 active crypto hedge funds. Almost two thirds of these (63%) were launched in 2018 or 2019. The average AUM increased from US$21.9 million to US$44 million.”Of the hedge funds surveyed, 97% traded BTC, Ether at 67%, XRP at 38%, Litecoin (LTC) at 38%, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at 31%, and EOS at 25%. The substantial increase in AUM may be attributed to the increase in the prices of cryptocurrencies.PwC partner and global crypto leader Henri Arslanian was quoted by Bloomberg: “I expect the crypto hedge fund industry to grow significantly over the coming years as investing in a crypto fund may be the easiest and most familiar entry point for many institutional investors looking at entering this space.”Hester Peirce, a commissioner with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, also sees institutional demand rising. She confidently stated that she has been “seeing more interest coming from institutional quarters than we have in the past. I think that will continue … as people are looking to diversify their portfolios, I think people are also likely to look more to the crypto space.”In conclusion, the crypto hedge fund space has proven via its growth, resilience and performance to be a significant investment opportunity. The PwC report, along with the concurrent opinions of several well-known figures in finance, is more evidence of that. Set alongside today’s backdrop of economic uncertainty, crypto hedge funds allow for an easy access point to this safe haven for institutional investors. What is most exciting, however, is that this is only the beginning.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Elvina Kamalova is a director of investments at Aludra Capital — a digital assets investment management firm based in San Francisco.

Source: Coin360Breaking through the $11,500-$11,800 range was the bulls most significant achievement of the last week and a number of analysts have noted that above the $12,000 level there is little overhead resistance.This has led some traders to forecast a swift move to the $14,000-$15,000 level.In a previous analysis, Cointelegraph contributor Micheal van de Poppe said that:“The $11,500-11,800 resistance area is an ancient and substantial area on the charts.

139,"The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly accelerated the digitalization of economies across the globe, opening up discussions on the future of digital financial services and whether our economy should advocate for the financial inclusion of Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets.Yet, despite the horror we have been seeing as our industries continue to suffer, the digital payments industry is expected to thrive, based upon recently reported data from the Consumer Confidence Index. Reaching a three-month high last month, consumer confidence data revealed a 12.1 jump from 85.9 in May to 98.1 in June.Last month when the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs held its virtual meeting, dubbed “The Digitization of Money and Payments,” the conversation primarily revolved around stablecoins and whether our economy is ready for a U.S. central bank digital currency.In case you missed it, it all came down to these two points, with committee chairman Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, explaining that our financial sector needs “rules of the road,” while Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, presented the question of: “Why on earth we would trust big tech with our banking system?”When it comes down to whether we need a digital dollar or not, I examined some of the discussion points throughout the hearing while diving into my continued belief that decentralized finance only emphasizes a need for a CBDC. Digital dollar, for the uninitiated, is an electronic credit that would only exist on computers, but like a traditional, physical fiat dollar, consumers and businesses could use it to pay one another.The opening statements of June’s hearing kicked off with Senator Crapo inviting witnesses to discuss why a CBDC is necessary now more than ever.In short, he wanted answers to:However, Senator Brown followed up with skepticism on entrusting big technology companies with managing our financial system, even in a digital world. Recognizing digital advancement, Senator Brown identified his concerns surrounding consumer protection and providing equal access to financial services, bolstering support for his own proposed legislation alternative: Banking for All Act. This alternative, according to Senator Brown, would allow all Americans to open zero-fee bank accounts at U.S. post offices, banks or online and connected directly to the Federal Reserve’s system. He said:“Banking for All means no more check-cashing fees, no more paying to use the money you already earned, [and] no more waiting until Wednesday to use money you were paid on Friday.”Brown added that friendlier technologies like a digital dollar would be a valuable tool as well.While the country’s economy has one of the highest penetrations of digital payment systems when compared to other economies, China, for example, seems to be taking the lead in legitimizing digital money and cryptocurrency in its economy. You can’t question its latest law after the Thirteenth National People’s Congress and Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference passed a new civil code designed to protect the civil rights of inheritance, marriage, property, personality, contract and infringement.Going into effect on Jan. 1, 2021, the new inheritance law not only identifies Bitcoin as one asset that could be inherited but it also allows China’s citizens to pass on their cryptocurrency and other digital assets to their heirs.The government has also rolled out a digital coin that looks to challenge the digital offerings of Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings. The reason is that it would enable better control of financial systems that are currently not possible with the yuan. Large-scale implementation of the coin would go live in 2022.If to compare, the complexity of the European Union’s economy and its legislation process tend to hamper the rolling-out of any common law, putting China ahead of the game. Attempting to address and minimize the chances of missing out on potential opportunities, many member states have already started to develop CBDCs separately.Back in June, the Italian Banking Association revealed, or ABI, it would be willing to support and pilot the implementation of a digital currency from the European Central Bank. On June 18, the ABI website shared that it had approved guidelines governing its position on digital currency and CBDCs.As for member nations such as Germany, Spain and France, which are also members of the Financial Stability Board, have appointed regulators to oversee the cryptocurrency market in their respective regions. The board is an international body comprising financial institutions, such as central banks and regulators that issues regulation recommendations.There is still a gap that can be filled here, however. If the EU can follow in China’s footsteps, there can still be room for a coherent law governing the region that would help reduce this regulatory uncertainty. The United Kingdom seems to have a measured approach when compared to its peers in the region. While there is no law governing cryptocurrencies, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has published guidelines on the tax treatment for cryptocurrencies.In a recent development, Valdis Dombrovskis, a member of the European Commission, advocated the use of digital finance by European countries.Currently, the state of our financial industries seems to remain in this “hesitancy” in realizing the “first-mover” advantage by regulators. Nobody wants to be the first to launch a CBDC and face the mistakes; it’s no different than our legal court system wanting to rule on a particular case in fear of being judged for botching what could be a landmark decision.But it is due to our regulators’ own fear that has prevented our financial sector and digital money’s landscape to realize its true potential. I’ve said it before and will continue to say that the digital money and blockchain space will continue to remain highly fragmented unless there are definite guidelines and educational resources made available so authorities of different economies can make the most appropriate decisions ahead of 2021.Recent developments seem to favor the acceptance of digital assets, and big players like Facebook have shown significant interest in entering the market with its Libra project. And, yes, Libra still has a long way to go before it can be considered a digital currency. Nonetheless, it is heartening to see the likes of China and the U.S. making headwinds that would prompt other countries to follow suit.But what has me most excited about the DeFi space? In my opinion, the growing acceptance has been bolstered by the fact that DeFi interfaces remained robust during March and did not require intervention by federal authorities to remain solvent.Remarkably, this financial landscape has thrived ever since the momentary crash recorded at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A new report by Dune Analytics revealed that the total number of users engaging with some form of a DeFi protocol has increased by 140% since the start of the year. Fortunately, the spike in usage has also translated to a rise in worth.The total value of capital locked in the DeFi landscape has doubled to $2 billion in under three weeks. This growth pattern is even more impressive if we consider that fewer than five DeFi platforms account for a large chunk of the market share.Until recently, MakerDAO was the poster child of the DeFi landscape — only to be leap-frogged by Compound thanks to the unprecedented impact of the launch of its governance token.Both DeFi ecosystems are currently the main drivers of the DeFi narrative as they account for over 60% of the value of assets locked in the DeFi market. Kava, a cross-chain DeFi platform, was launched to challenge the likes of Compound and Maker. Its recently proposed Uber-like blockchain model is one I highly suggest familiarizing yourself with.Without a doubt, the concentration of market shares to a handful of platforms highlights the nascency of the landscape and the sort of growth potential that could thrust more projects and tokens into the limelight.Another token-based DeFi ecosystem positioned to capitalize on this growth trend is Level01. Although the lending niche remains the most attractive use case of DeFi technology, Level01 has introduced its token as a viable decentralized financial tool poised for mainstream success.The peer-to-peer derivative trading platform exposes traders to a wide array of markets, including forex, gold, oil, stocks, cryptocurrencies and so on, by providing a transparent trading infrastructure with advanced risk/reward functionalities.However, regardless of the DeFi hype and the promising stints of selected tokens, the biggest obstacles for players taking the sideline continue to be price volatility, concerns around market manipulation and lack of fundamentals to gauge appropriate value. These concerns could be mitigated if larger institutions started showing interest and considered it as a regular form of investment.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Andrew Rossow is a millennial attorney, law professor, entrepreneur, writer and speaker on privacy, cybersecurity, AI, AR/VR, blockchain and digital currencies.

140,"In the last two weeks, Ether (ETH) price increased by 75% as the price rallied from $222 to $400. Many investors believe Ether’s momentum is buoying the entire market, and possibly even pushing Bitcoin (BTC) upwards.ETH-USD daily chart. Source: TradingView.comThree factors that appear to be triggering the strong Ether rally are: DeFi, ETH 2.0, and the current prolonged rally taking place in the altcoin market.Since mid-June, the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has continuously surged. The launch of protocol-specific tokens, like Compound’s COMP as an example, led to growing demand for DeFi.Eventually, users discovered a phenomenon called “yield farming”, which involves users searching for higher yields in the DeFi market and switching from one protocol to another to obtain incentives.The explosive growth of the DeFi market in a short period led many DeFi-connected tokens to surge rapidly. In July, investors seemingly sold off DeFi tokens and other small market cap altcoins, moving back to Ether and Bitcoin.On August 1 Ether price reached a 2-year high as it surged to $395 on BitMEX but this has traders warning against a potential pullback. In fact, crypto-trader Edward Morra said:“Yeah, parabola coming out of another parabola is a sight to behold tbh. Also, this isn't sustainable and will correct. If you are new to this space - buy dips, don't FOMO at the top.”A consistent positive factor that supports the upward momentum of Ether is the anticipation for ETH 2.0. In August, Ethereum developers expect to launch the final testnet of ETH 2.0 called Medalla.When fully launched, ETH 2.0 would gradually eliminate miners from the network and reward users for participating in the network. The incentive system would enable users to earn a yield on their Ether holdings over a long period.Kelvin Koh, the co-founder of a venture capital Spartan Black, recently suggested that every phase of Ether would strengthen Ethereum. Koh said:“Every phase of ETH 2.0 over the next 2-3 years brings Ethereum closer to its final state and will be catalysts for ETH.”The Ether and Bitcoin rally over the last three days coincided with a drop-off in altcoin prices. In the near-term, the cycle of profit taking could continue if altcoins see regular uptrends.In previous bull markets, major cryptocurrencies and small altcoins showed an inverse correlation, meaning, as the price of Bitcoin surged, altcoin values dropped.The opposite remains true when Bitcoin price is stable or consolidating. This creates a cycle that causes BTC and ETH to benefit from multiple profit-taking rallies.Satoshi Flipper, a popular trader on Twitter, suggested that in the longer-term there is a key resistance for Ether at $780.ETH-USD 1-week chart. Source: Satoshi FlipperIt remains to be seen whether the confluence of ETH 2.0, profit-taking rallies, and DeFi growth could push Ether price to higher resistance areas. For now, the sentiment around the altcoin generally remains positive in the medium-term."
141,"Recently, crypto traders have shown a lot of enthusiasm for decentralized exchanges, or DEXs. The enthusiasm is warranted. We’re starting to see the fruits of many years of hard work pay off with DEX trading volume and use increasing every day. In spite of this growth, the vast majority of crypto trading still takes place on centralized exchanges. DEXs offer a clear set of benefits in terms of fund security, flexible custody and transparency, so why is it that the majority of the market still shuns them in favor of centralized alternatives? We think we know the answer, and we’ve spent the last year and a half working to build a next-generation DEX that can go head-to-head with centralized exchanges. We continue to make progress, and we want to share some reflections, insights and observations that have shaped our innovations.Market makers drive the crypto market. They bring much-needed liquidity to platforms, without which it’s impossible to attract traders and end users. Market makers are the linchpin of the exchange flywheel. Additional liquidity brings more traders, which brings more market makers, which brings more liquidity — and so on.We’ve spent countless hours talking with the most influential traders and market makers in the industry, and two things are clear:(Almost) none of them are market making on DEXs todayAll of them are interested in market making on DEXs in the future.So, what’s the problem? The glaring issue is that market makers have spent millions of dollars and working hours to build technology and human capital that interface with existing exchanges. These systems are built with certain assumptions around performance and features — assumptions that are broken by all existing DEXs. We can’t expect market makers to rebuild their systems from the ground up for a tiny slice of the overall market. If we want to tackle centralized exchanges with any level of success, we have to meet these important participants where they are today.You may be thinking you already know the answer. Everyone has heard the criticism that the current generation of DEXs doesn’t scale. Multiple teams are seeking to address this by implementing layer-two systems that can lower transaction costs for trade settlement.These new developments are great and bring much-needed room for growth — provided anyone uses the product in the first place. Layer-two systems only remove limitations on growth; they don’t do anything to make the exchange an attractive product in the first place. Any serious trading product must first meet the bar set by existing alternatives before it is able to compete on a unique selling proposition, which in the case of DEXs is custody flexibility and transparent fund security.So, what’s really going on? If we take a deeper look at the current landscape for decentralized trading products, we can conclude that three primary issues are plaguing DEXs and preventing wider adoption and use:    1. High latency and low performanceThese items lead to a whole host of issues. Front-running and trade collisions break “price-time priority” and lead to unfair trade execution. Delays in execution of trades or cancels make it impossible for market makers to quote deep, tight spreads, lest they risk getting arbitraged due to price changes on other venues.To address this, an exchange must have a high-performance, in-memory trading engine. It must also be able to handle bursts of traffic and hundreds of thousands of orders per second with low millisecond latency. A simple layer-two system is not sufficient to provide the performance and execution guarantees that the market demands.    2. Lack of features and non-standard formatsMarket makers and algorithmic traders have a large number of venues to choose from. These players assess new opportunities not only by the potential revenue and income they will generate but also by the upfront integration and ongoing maintenance costs. This ratio of opportunity to cost is the most important determining factor, as it’s a representation of the efficiency of their development work and capital.DEXs need to be 100% plug-and-play in order for new participants to join and provide liquidity with minimal effort. After all, if you’ve already designed a winning strategy, why take the time to redo it to suit a market share of less than 2%? This includes offering the same advanced order types as other top tier exchanges, and an API format and documentation that adheres to the unofficial standards that have emerged.    3. Lack of complianceKnow Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering policies are a reality for all participants with significant amounts of capital. We’ve had multiple conversations with market makers that declined to engage with us under the assumption that, as a DEX, we weren’t compliant. Whether we like it or not, it’s impossible for high net worth individuals and institutional players to trade on platforms that don’t meet their basic compliance needs.Analyzing current products through this lens, we can see why DEX adoption is still limited. We used off-chain execution to eliminate on-chain front-running and trade collisions, but it did not have the matching engine necessary to provide the execution guarantees that top participants demanded. The API did not adhere to industry standards, which led to unnecessary complexity and stifled development efforts.Automated market makers, or AMMs, are a clever solution to circumvent some of the latency and performance issues that make it impossible to host a liquid order book on-chain (pricing in AMMs is only updated when someone takes an order). However, these pricing curves are, by definition, a less flexible option than order books and far from ideal for professional market makers who have the capacity to make markets more efficiently. Additionally, due to the use of on-chain execution, these platforms suffer from front-running and manipulation.Existing layer-two DEXs have a similar set of issues. The lack of a proper matching engine leads to inefficient pricing and robs market makers of necessary execution guarantees. User friction such as the need to register separate keys, asset quanta and other factors makes it time-consuming for developers to adapt their operations to support layer-two DEXs. In addition, market makers still need to contend with the security implications of using relatively immature cryptography to secure valuable crypto assets.Ultimately, scalability still matters, but only if you have something worth scaling. The issue at the moment for central limit order book DEXs is not so much that we can’t fit enough transactions on-chain but that the process for creating these settlement transactions is clunky and unintuitive.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Alex Wearn is the co-founder and CEO of IDEX, a cryptocurrency exchange focused on performance and security. .

142,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a great week with a surge to $11,700. After two months of consolidating inside a range, the price of Bitcoin finally broke through the psychological barrier of $10,000 and currently faces the final hurdle before the bull market can start. Most often, people become bullish once they see green candles, with which extraordinary targets can be found on social media. Can these be justified or is a cool-down period more likely in the near term? Cryptocurrency market daily snapshot 1/8/2020. Source: Coin360As Bitcoin’s price broke through the barrier of $10,000, the next significant resistance zone became the $11,500-11,800 area. Since BTC was range-bound for two months, the breakout ended up being a very volatile move as anticipated, going up by $1,500 after this breakout finally happened. BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewGiven that the price of Bitcoin surged this fast in such a short period of time, it’s not likely that the price of Bitcoin breaks through the resistance zone in one-go. The $11,500-11,800 resistance area is an ancient and substantial area on the charts. Not only did this level serve as resistance throughout the summer of 2019, but it also acted as resistance during the peak mania of December 2017.Therefore, this is essentially the last massive level for resistance. If the price of Bitcoin breaks through this zone, then there is a lot of open range above and a new bull market will be upon us.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewInterestingly, the majority of the CME Bitcoin futures gaps get filled. However, they don’t necessarily get filled immediately as today has shown. The chart above, for example, is showing a gap at $11,700 from August 2019 that just got filled.What’s next? The chart is showing a clear gap in the $9,700-10,000 area, unfilled. The likelihood of this gap to be filled starts to increase with the current upward momentum, making a retrace toward the $9,800 area more likely with each day.BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 1-hour chart is showing a clear uptrend and holding the previous resistance zone at $11,400 is crucial for the bulls.An example can be seen in the previous resistance zone. Bitcoin’s price couldn’t break through the $11,200 level for a few days, but after three tests, the breakthrough occurred. Immediately after, the price confirmed the previous resistance zone as a support level and continued the rally. An identical approach is required for the $11,400 level. If that level holds for support, more continuation is expected toward $12,000. If the level is lost, a further correction towards $10,800 or lower becomes very possible.Total market capitalization cryptocurrency 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe total market capitalization broke through the crucial barrier of $270 billion and immediately flipped that level into support. This support/resistance flip was the start of an even more significant surge, as the total market cap touched the $350 billion level. However, is further continuation warranted? Very unlikely, given the immense expansion of the past two weeks. A reasonable approach would be a test of the previous resistance as a new support level at around $285 billion. BTC/USD 1-day bullish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bullish scenario depends on the crucial threshold of $11,300-11,400 as the pivot to hold for the price of Bitcoin.A bullish breakout would preferably see the price of Bitcoin clear the $11,500-11,700 resistance zone and flip that area for support. As stated previously, this is the final significant hurdle. If Bitcoin’s price breaks through the resistance zone and conquers this level, further upward momentum can be expected.The levels to watch if Bitcoin breaks through this resistance are primarily the next resistance zones found between $15,000-17,000. BTC/USD 1-day bearish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, is such a breakout likely to occur after the recent expansion? It seems very unreasonable to break through a resistance zone of such significance in one try. A more reasonable approach is a renewed range-bound construction, just like the previous months have been. The green zone between $9,700-10,000 is crucial to hold. If that area flips for support (after rejecting the $11,500-11,800 area), a new range is defined, and the price of Bitcoin can then move sideways for several months. This range-bound construction would also line up with the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs) as these are still below the spot price. As long as this remains unchanged, the BTC price is in bull territory.Once Bitcoin starts to consolidate and correct, major altcoins will most likely do the same, and then the money will flow from the majors and Bitcoin toward the smaller cap coins and tokens. In other words, the current “altseason” may still have a lot more room to run.

143,"Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading has been on a high since July 21 with both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Bakkt seeing sizeable increases in volume and open interest for their contracts. This resurgence in BTC futures comes as the spot market value of the largest crypto by market capitalization reached a new 2020 high.Two months on from the May 2020 halving event, BTC has begun to show signs of the anticipated bullish advance. Bitcoin usually sets a new all-time high in the year following a block reward subsidy decrease, with BTC optimists stating the trend will continue.Amid the current positive price action for Bitcoin, bullish sentiment appears to be gathering steam in the BTC futures market. Long positions currently outnumber shorts by almost 9-to-1, which means that any significant downward retracement could see a cascade of liquidations on optimistic bets, especially for traders with overleveraged longs. Back in mid-March 2020, the market panic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic saw Bitcoin fall to $3,800. This drop caused a cascade of forced liquidations, especially on derivatives exchanges like BitMEX.The price surge for BTC comes amid a raft of positive news for the crypto space with the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency allowing national banks to offer cryptocurrency custody services. Major economies have also been moving toward stimulus packages to alleviate the disruptions occasioned by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. EU leaders have already approved a $2-trillion spending plan with almost half of the earmarked sum geared to support economies hardest-hit by COVID-19. In the U.S., lawmakers have been working on another round of stimulus payments, which could go as high as $3 trillion.With the U.S. Federal Reserve printing more money in one month than in the last 200 years, investors appear to be keen on hedging against the attendant risk of currency debasement. This sentiment appears to be providing significant tailwinds for haven assets like BTC and gold. Bitcoin’s rise to a new 2020 high also coincided with gold setting a new price record per ounce. Indeed, the precious metal is close to crossing the $2,000 landmark, with silver also at its highest level in over seven years.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin futures open interest has been on the rise in tandem with the gains seen in the spot market. According to data from crypto derivatives analytics platform Skew, CME BTC futures open interest is at an all-time high of $740M.A week after “Black Thursday,” CME Bitcoin futures open interest almost fell to their lowest level in three months. However, as spot price recovered in the weeks that followed, so too did the open interest in CME’s cash-settled BTC futures contract until the May halving. With the block reward subsidy event not triggering any immediate price gains, OI took a significant dip once again. At the time, retail crypto derivatives traders suffered liquidations to the tune of about $1.3 billion, as the BTC price saw a retrace from $10,000 to the $8,600 support level.It is perhaps interesting to note that while OI is on the rise, trading volume has cooled off significantly over the last few days of July. The same trend can be observed for Bakkt, with open interest at an all-time high of $22 million, but trading volume has been on a downward slide for both its cash and physically settled futures contracts.Indeed, the rising OI in Bitcoin futures is representative of the trend seen in the crypto derivatives arena as a whole. According to its Q2 2020 report, market analytics platform TokenInsight revealed that marketwide cryptocurrency derivatives OI rose from $2.62 billion to $5.53 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Typically, high OI and low volume point toward more exposure-driven activity than actual trading. Often, this scenario indicates that traders are looking to short Bitcoin’s price.However, according to data from on-chain analytics platform Datamish.com, the ratio of percent longs to short is almost at its highest level in 2020. This trend suggests that traders expect that Bitcoin still has room for more upside. Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital, told Cointelegraph that the high OI points toward traders expecting an impending uptick in volatility:“At this time, Bitcoin is at a critical level. If it holds above $11,000 for a week or so, we can expect further appreciation. However, it will only be around $15K that we can expect actual retail FOMO and the possibility of a parabolic advance.”For Adam Todd, the CEO of crypto derivatives exchange Digitex Futures, the rising OI means more money flowing into the Bitcoin futures market. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Todd stated: “Generally, a rise in open interest means that the price will also rise as new money comes into the market.” Rising open interest amid declining volume also points to traders electing to adopt longer holding periods. With Bitcoin price volatility dropping to all-time lows before this current surge, short-term funds would have become unprofitable.The rising OI for CME and Bakkt is one of the many indications of increasing institutional activity in Bitcoin and crypto in general. Grayscale, the largest cryptocurrency hedge fund, has recently seen its total assets under management top the $5-billion mark.Indeed, Grayscale’s AUM grew by about $500 million in barely a week to add to the over $1.4-billion surge recorded in the first half of 2020. While the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is still the overwhelmingly dominant product in the company’s catalog, Litecoin (LTC) shares have grown over the past month, which indicates some institutional appetite for the seventh-largest crypto by market capitalization. The surge in Litecoin share ownership coincided with LTC keeping up with Bitcoin’s price gains even as other altcoins saw red. Commenting on the prospects of greater institutional involvement in Bitcoin, Todd remarked:“I think that Bitcoin’s recent breakout, especially at a time when traditional markets are so uncertain, will certainly cause more institutional investors to take a second, third or even fourth look at adding BTC to their portfolios. However, institutions will likely wait for a price correction, unlike retail investors they are not going to chase a rally.”Apart from futures, the OI for Bitcoin options has also seen a similar increase. Of the $2.2 billion in total open interest for BTC options, Deribit accounts for $1.79 billion, which amounts to an 80% dominance of the market. Again, as is the case with the futures arena, the rising OI for BTC options is happening alongside a decline in trading volume. Apart from dominating the Bitcoin options OI, Deribit also controls over 90% of the market’s trading volume, up from the 60% dominance achieved in Q2 2020.Data from Skew shows the Bitcoin options put/call ratio, or PCR, is beginning to climb steadily. A rising PCR typically indicates bullish sentiments, and at 0.63, traders appear to be expecting more upside for BTC. However, when PCR begins to approach the 1.0 mark, a contrarian interpretation usually forms for the indicator, as high PCR values usually front-run the emergence of bearish sentiments as seen in May before the halving event. Leading up to the 2020 halving, the Bitcoin options PCR rose to 0.81, its highest level in 2020. A few days later, BTC experienced a retrace from $10,000 to the $8,600 price level.A similar situation occurred the last time the BTC options PCR nearly reached 1.0, which was in late June 2019. Bitcoin went on a downward slide for the second half of 2019, ending the year at $7,300. If the trend holds, then the current upward price action could be interrupted by a significant pullback. According to DiPasquale, such a retrace is to be expected:“Nearly all quick surges are followed by pullbacks, which are healthy for market action since profit-taking allows investors/traders to take breaks, and new capital can enter the market as floors are established. At the moment, the zone between $10,000 and $10,500 presents a solid support zone for any pullbacks.”The 106,000 BTC (~$1.2 billion) in Bitcoin futures and options that expired on July 31 might also have some impact on the price action in Q3 2020. For Bitcoin options, over $1.4 billion in aggregate open interest is still available to trade in August and September.With Bitcoin breaking from its sideways accumulation, crypto derivatives trading might see a resurgence in Q3 2020. According to the TokenInsight report, cryptocurrency derivatives trading topped $2 trillion for the second quarter in a row, resulting in “a year-on-year increase of 165.56% from the second quarter of 2019.”With $2.159 trillion in volume, crypto derivatives accounted for about 27.4% of the total cryptocurrency trading market, as reported by TokenInsight. Despite the lull in price action for about half of the period, the crypto derivatives niche still saw a marginal increase while spot volume fell 18%."
144,"PlanB, the well-known creator of the contested stock-to-flow (S2F) model, believes Bitcoin (BTC) is now well on track to reach $100,000 as the price has risen to yearly highs. The optimistic sentiment coincides with the shift in momentum from alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, to BTC.He said:“I can't make a chart for you now (at sea), but S2F model perfectly on track.”At the same time, the price of Bitcoin has increased by 17% this week, as it broke through a major three-year trendline. As Cointelegraph reported, traders seemingly expect BTC to test higher resistance levels in the near term.The price of Bitcoin surpasses $11,700 in a swift intraday rally. Source: TradingView.comAltcoin declined particularly in the past 72 hours when the price of Bitcoin started to rally. Ethereum’s Ether (ETH) moved in tandem with BTC throughout the rally, but it slumped against BTC in the past two days.In the short term, as Bitcoin sees a profit-taking rally from altcoins, some investors expect BTC to outperform altcoins. Kelvin Koh, the co-founder of Asia-based venture capital firm Spartan Group, said:“If BTC breaks the resistance at $11.4K, we are going above $12K in no time. Will take the wind out of alts again short term.”The pattern of a Bitcoin rally following a strong altcoin season is not new. In previous cycles, the top cryptocurrency typically saw a sharp uptrend after altcoins initially gained against BTC. Such a trend materializes because investors seek safer options, like BTC, when the altcoin market gets overheated.Most recently, the fear of missing out, or FOMO, of retail investors around DeFi led small market cap tokens to surge substantially. In the early days of the DeFi market craze, for example, Compound (COMP) saw a major rally. Then, smaller tokens, including Yearn Finance (YFI), Synthetix Network (SNX), and Aave (LEND), followed.Eventually, as small tokens saw five to ten-fold spikes in price, investors started to take profit. The abrupt pullback of DeFi tokens coincided with a BTC rally as momentum shifted back to Bitcoin.Data from Skew shows that tens of millions of dollars worth of short contracts are still getting liquidated. It indicates that a relatively large number of investors are betting against BTC in the near term.Bitcoin liquidations on BitMEX. Source: SkewCryptocurrency trader Cantering Clark said that while he understands why shorts are compelling, the upward trend is too strong. He said:“Looking at trades from the standpoint of R:R is good, but understanding context is superior. After a major contextual change like this, you can assume that your shorts have a lower probability of resolving successfully. Bets should be on strength always showing up.”For some traders, a short against Bitcoin could be attractive because BTC has increased steeply in the past week and is testing major resistance levels. A 17% rally in six days — even during a bull market — is substantial, even for Bitcoin. But when the trend of BTC is overwhelmingly bullish, a short squeeze could only add more rocket fuel.In the last 12 hours, more than $23 million worth of shorts were liquidated, for example, as the price hit as high as $11,750. Thus, during a strong upward price trend, shorts could indirectly catalyze a larger rally."
145,"As interest in smart contracts surges, some Bitcoiners are asking: why can't Bitcoin (BTC) become the foundation for smart contracts too, instead of Ethereum (ETH)?Muneeb Ali, co-founder and CEO of Blockstack open-source platform, believes that the best way to bring about a user-owned internet ""is to anchor applications and smart contracts to the Bitcoin network in a way that uses Bitcoin as a reserve currency and its powerful blockchain as a security mechanism.""In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Ali stated that Bitcoin has been the king of blockchains for more than a decade, as most people have come to recognize that the Bitcoin network is “unparalleled” when it comes to security:“We believe that the new Stacks 2.0 blockchain, currently in testnet, holds one solution for making Bitcoin the foundation for smart contracts in Web 3.0. With the Clarity smart contract programming language and the Proof of Transfer mechanism, developers can build smart contracts in a much more secure language that is predictable, decidable.”Traditionally, Bitcoin has been recognized as a secure network, whereas Ethereum has been a “frontrunner” when it comes to smart contracts, according to Ali. Blockstack’s founder elaborated further on the discussion:“Bitcoin’s limited scripting language has been seen as a dealbreaker to developers looking to build dapps or deploy smart contracts. As a result, many developers end up building their own blockchains, hoping to bootstrap native proof-of-work protocols or proof-of-stake, but these tend to be much less secure. One of the results is developers assume Ethereum is better suited for launching smart contracts, but I believe this is premature.”Ali also pointed out that the future of the internet will not be a “tradeoff of convenience for security,” but will instead be tying that security to web applications in a way that uses Bitcoin as a reserve currency along with its blockchain as a security mechanism.Regarding the web 3.0 era, Ali thinks that of particular note is the recent “rise in conversation about the possibilities of ‘DeFi on the Bitcoin’.” For the Blockstack’s founder, this means more people are looking to anchor in the security of Bitcoin when it comes to financial products:“Many people think that it is easier to recreate Bitcoin on top of Ethereum, but it actually makes more sense to create Ethereum functionality on top of Bitcoin. The adoption of this is still nascent but people are definitely starting to realize the value of building on the Bitcoin ecosystem rather than parallel to it.”"
146,"Title token is a record of ownership similar to the one made in a traditional estate registry. This concept is designed as an alternative to security tokens and various financial crypto instruments. The title token is not “backed” with real property; this is the record that directly certifies the property right — the same as paper title deeds, or certificate of ownership, etc. It is a digital form of property record and the primary source of knowledge about property rights, which means no paper form is needed.The title token can represent any legal rights: immovable property (land and buildings), movable (car, boats, aircraft, etc.), corporate rights (shares), and various property rights and derivatives (mortgage, debts and securities). Any legal right, and as you will see later, can be used to certify legal facts and events.You can create tokens that represent a flock of sheep because it does not require official registration. But you cannot just create a token of your land rights (car, boat, etc.). It will be a toy token with no connection with your legal rights because they “live” in the official state-owned registries. In most countries, registries, especially for land rights, are mandatory, and the regulations do not provide discretion in choosing one or another.To enable blockchain technology to replace the traditional registries, the state machine requires reforms, which are unlikely to happen in the nearest future. What is more feasible is the recognition of alternative registries, so citizens themselves may choose. Those who are happy with traditional registries and bureaucracy can stay with these, but those who want to use the full power of blockchain, smart contracts and decentralized applications can transfer their records from the centralized database to any ledger.Now, states monopolistically own and run public registries. Alternative registries can be enabled through new regulations, technical standards and government supervision to ensure compliance. But the authorities do not need to physically maintain such alternative ledgers and data centers for them to protect records. Blockchain technology ensures an unprecedented level of protection for records from corruption. Acts of public bodies performed on-chain will guarantee their accountability. Undoubtedly, it is better for the investment climate for any world’s region where it will be introduced.Interestingly, blockchain technology fits into both types of property registries that exist in the world. The American system of the registration of conveyance creates a chain of title deeds. It fits into the blockchain technology, which is based on a familiar chain of transactions. The second type is the Torrens system, and registries in civil law countries, where the registry is designed to track down not deeds but titles fit into the concept of tokens. Tokens on a blockchain enable the title-centric type of public registry and, at the same time, completely mimic the system of a chain of deeds.Undoubtedly, yes. For example, there is a “smart will,” and after the owner’s death, it must bequeath the tokens to the rightful heir. How will the smart will know that the landlord is deceased? Or what if another heir has a claim? The belief of many crypto enthusiasts that with blockchain technology, we can get rid of third parties is not realistic, at least not at this level of science and technology. A blockchain as a repository of evidence does not need a third party to maintain it, but we still need third parties to certify various facts of our life. It is not just about birth and death. A person from Argentina will not buy a bungalow remotely on Bali because the bungalow token that represents the title is just a declaration of the owner. To make the transaction happen remotely, they need a third party whom the buyer and the seller can trust, which will confirm that this token represents this property right. Normally, this job is done by public bodies and registry.Cross Reference is a basic protocol to maintain the validity of records. A typical scenario is that the end-user creates a token, which can represent a digital identity, property rights, a physical object, a fact or event, and includes the reference (link) to the token, which provides the information of its validity. Changes in both records reflect legal changes in the object. The token owner can make a transfer of the token to change ownership, while the validator can change its validity (legal status).Use case. Alice creates a token (a key-value record that carries some user’s data) for her title, and Bob, who is a town clerk, creates his token that says “Alice’s Title is valid.” If Alice loses her private key, she will ask Bob to update his token, mark it “invalid,” and reissue a new token certificate.In a more general scheme, cross-referencing is a method of providing status records by trusted third parties that have knowledge about legal facts and events. The blockchain doesn’t make them valid, but the authority that certifies the fact. Blockchain technology just has a better infrastructure for this system to make sure these records are uncorrupted.Alice creates a record (token) on a blockchain. Bob says it is valid. If Alice loses her private key, Bob will publish the record that says it is not valid anymore.If you have heard from some crypto skeptics that the problem of blockchain technology is that it does not tolerate mistakes because no one can alter or delete data, as you can see, the ledger immutability is not a problem; it is just a matter of better application design. The idea of creating permissioned ledgers to fix mistakes leads us back to centralized registries where censorship and altering records are legitimate tools and all are built around the trust to those who maintain the ledger. Due to no censorship, any junk data is possible on public blockchains. So, the validity here is provided by the traditional trusted parties through cross-referencing. Though their acts are not hidden as in any state-owned database, they are transparent and, hence, accountable. With cross-reference, it is possible to address not only the loss of private keys but legal disputes and various procedures for obtaining permits from the government agencies.Use case: Building permit. Alice wants to build a house on her land. She applies for permits to: (1) a town clerk; (2) the architecture department; (3) the department for environment and heritage, and so on. Each of these authorities creates its own tokens (certificates) on ledgers to certify permits. Alice adds references to each of these certificates in her token record. To check whether Alice built the house lawfully, the inquirer searches Alice’s token and verifies references whether they are valid and issued by authorized agencies.But what if Bob, a town clerk, corrupted the system? For example, Alice was unlawfully deprived of her rights to land. There is a system of root records. Firstly, the public body may be hierarchical, and therefore, the higher authorities may deem the clerk’s record as unlawful. Here comes the real power of blockchain technology. The entire time, Alice still owns her token even if Bob issues a transaction that it is invalid. After her claim, Alice has been restored in her rights. She will update her token to include a new reference to Dave’s (a new town clerk) record, who says she has the right.To eliminate dead-end situations when neither party has access to their records, there is a root record, which can issue patches to the system. Patches are also published on-chain, though they must belong to the root address, which is initially set up in the public registry. We need patches to filter out those records that aren’t relevant or illegal. Technically, we don’t delete them because it is impossible on a blockchain. But because we have an overlaid system scanning records on a blockchain and detecting valid ones from it (as we remember blockchain can carry on a lot of junk data), the patch is the record, which is also published on a blockchain but comes from a trusted address. This patch “tells” your system which record or address must be filtered out.The root can belong to a court. There might be multiple roots based on branches of power (legislative, executive, judicial), and of course, the root can be controlled collectively through a multi-signature scheme — to make sure that those who have a mandate of power make lawful decisions. Eventually, we will likely see the system of a direct e-voting (e-referendum) where not only the representatives of a collective body (council, parliament, committee) make transactions but all the citizens of a town, a state or a whole country.The most fundamental thing here is that a digital dictatorship has no chance. Even if abuse of power occurs, acts of public bodies must be recorded on-chain. Otherwise, they will not influence any records on the blockchain, including patches. Each node is independent and can be run by any user because it is a blockchain. And each node adds the list of trusted roots, but we always have the right not to trust them, and this discussion is not about blockchain technology as you see it.Technically, the system can be completely reset. You specify new roots, from which new authorities publish new patches. Your node scans the ledger from the very beginning, and the system applies new filters and rules provided by the patches. As a result, you get a new representation of the current state of the public property registry.Governance is not a matter of mathematical consensus. The interpretation of records is a layer above blockchains that represents the social consensus. How we decided which root addresses we trust, how and when we reset roots, is a matter of the political system. The only thing that is unchanged is the blockchain. As a public repository it keeps all kinds of records as evidence of everything that happens in the real world.This is part two of a three-part series on the theory of title token — read part one on the blockchain estate registry here, and part three on the new generation of public property registries here.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Oleksii Konashevych is the author of the Cross-Blockchain Protocol for Government Databases: The Technology for Public Registries and Smart Laws.

As BTC/USD demonstrates strong momentum, investors believe there is little resistance until $15,000.Cryptocurrency market daily snapshot.

He notes that there is less resistance between $12,000 and $15,000. Davis said:“What’s crazy is the weekend move hasn’t even started yet.  How much resistance is there at $12-15k?”The weekly chart of Bitcoin shows that historically, there is a lack of price action between $12,000 and $15,000. The last time BTC surpassed $11,600 was in mid-2019 when it surged to a multi-year high of $14,000 before rejecting.The daily chart of Bitcoin with a major resistance level. Source: TradingView.comAlso worth noting is that the price of Bitcoin soared to an all-time high in 2017 within two weeks after hitting $11,600.According to Michael van de Poppe, the market structure of Bitcoin would remain compelling if it holds $11,400. Stability above the $11,400 level would show that it has turned into a support level. Van de Poppe said:“Yep, $11,200 broke and flipped support -> $11,500-11,700 test and CME gap closed. One sidenote; EUR/USD is correcting. I do believe Gold, Silver & $BTC will do the same. Crucial threshold? Holding $11,400.”At the same time, data from Skew shows less than $20 million worth of futures contracts were liquidated on this Bitcoin uptick. When the BTC price movement is driven by the futures market, it often leads to heightened levels of liquidations.The lackluster amount of liquidations in the futures market suggests that it is likely the spot and options market catalyzing the rally. If the Bitcoin futures market is less heated, it leads to a more stable and fundamentally strong bull cycle, which some prominent analysts argue is now starting.At a higher time frame, a pseudonymous trader known as “Rookie” said the monthly candles of Bitcoin and Ethereum mark a bullish trend. The confluence of a favorable macro market structure and a neutral futures market could maintain BTC’s momentum. The trader said:“Both BTC and ETH monthly candles have essentially closed at their highest points of the month. NO upper wick. This is bullish.”In the near-term, the biggest obstacle of Bitcoin is whether it can defend the major $11,400 level as a support area. Traders generally remain positive as BTC begins to break out and outperform alternative cryptocurrencies."

Earlier today BTC price reached $11,444 but it quickly rejected back to the $11,250 range.Surprisingly, within the last hour the price has risen above the $11,400 mark again and some traders believe that repeated retests of the resistance could raise the chances of a breakout.Spartan Group’s Kelvin Koh said that when BTC breaks out of $11,400, a rally to $12,000 is likely. Meanwhile, on-chain analyst and trader Willy Woo said Bitcoin’s rally above $11,000 could place BTC at the start of the “main bull phase.”The 1-hour price chart of Bitcoin.

Currently, the resistance range from $11,200 to $11,400 is seemingly triggering sellers to defend this level and prevent a major breakout.On June 27, on-chain analyst and Bitcoin trader Willy Woo revealed a new price model for BTC. The model suggested that a new bull run for the top cryptocurrency is brewing. At the time, Woo said:“This is a new model I'm working on, it picks the start of exponential bull runs. 1) Bitcoin was setting up for a bullish run until the COVID white swan killed the party. 2) This model suggests we are close to another bullish run. Maybe another month to go.”The weekly price chart of Bitcoin with a new price model. Source: Willy WooA month has passed since the model was revealed and the price of Bitcoin has increased from $9,100 to over $11,000. Following up on the model, Woo said he is “relatively confident” the main bull phase is igniting.The analyst broke down various on-chain data points, including Bitcoin’s mempool and the relative strength index (RSI), to evaluate market cycles. Woo said that the on-chain RSI, specifically, suggests the main bull market could begin in the fourth quarter.Woo explained that:“With the current break to 11K, I'm relatively confident last months model is working on queue, we're at the start of the ‘main bull phase’... 365 day on-chain RSI shows the compression at the early phase of the bull cycle nearing completion, I'm expecting RSI expansion that typifies the main bull season run starting Q4 2020 into 2021.”Similarly, Koh said that if the price of Bitcoin continues to increase above $11,400, it will sustain its momentum. But if BTC continues to rally, the investor emphasized that alternative cryptocurrencies could consolidate. Koh said:“If BTC breaks the resistance at $11.4K, we are going above $12K in no time. Will take the wind out of altcoins again in the short term.”According to ExoAlpha chief investment officer David Lifchitz, profit-taking from well-performing DeFi tokens led BTC and Ether (ETH) to surge. The initial upsurge then led to short contracts on futures exchanges being liquidated.As Bitcoin started to rally, DeFi tokens and other top alternative cryptocurrencies started to decline, which strengthens the argument. Assets in the likes of Compound, Chainlink, and Cardano, which outperformed BTC in June, stagnated in the past several days.Lifchitz told Cointelegraph:“The recent move in BTC-USD seems to have been linked to DeFi coins profit-taking rolled into the majors (Bitcoin and Ethereum), which triggered a short squeeze of the overleveraged shorts at the BitMEX casino.”In the short-term, Lifchitz said a pullback could occur as the market cools down, but if BTC surpasses $12,500 and remains on top of it, a bull market could then materialize. Lifchitz said:“So basically, the run-up in Bitcoin seems more driven by rotation and a devaluating USD than a genuine interest in the coin, but should BTC reach and remain above $12,500 (i.e. July 2019 high) it could change the narrative. In the short term, a small pullback might be in the making, which would be healthy from here before engaging in a new run to $12,500.”Overall, traders and on-chain analysts remain positive after Bitcoin’s relatively swift rally above $11,000.There are some risks of a pullback as the futures market gets overheated with high funding rates, but the sentiment appears to be improving, and BTC is repeatedly testing a key resistance level at $11,400 as a result."

Although this number might seem daunting, the truth is less than $500 million expired today.

Unlike futures markets, there is not much benefit in rolling over options over the last trading days.Options contracts are a winner takes it all market, as those heavily underwater are deemed worthless.

But while the momentum of BTC also pushed up the price of other top cryptocurrencies, including Ether (ETH), key metrics and technical patterns suggest the chances of a pullback are rising. Cryptocurrency market snapshot July 31. Source: Coin360Three factors that hint at a drop are the fear and greed index, a potential Wyckoff pattern and major resistance.According to data from Alternative.me’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index, the market sentiment is at greed. The index has hit 75 points, and every time the index reached a clear peak, Bitcoin corrected.The Crypto Fear & Greed Index 1-year chart. Source: Alternative.meThe last time the index reached a local top was in February 2020, when it reached 65 points. A month after, the price of Bitcoin dropped to as low as $3,596 on BitMEX.Historical data shows that when the index hits a new high, BTC tends to pull back. But the way the market sentiment is measured is highly subjective. For instance, 30% of the index is composed of social media and surveys, which are non-quantifiable data. In a prolonged bull market, cryptocurrencies can stay overheated for an extended period, as seen in 2018 and 2019. As an example, the price of Bitcoin rose to as high as $14,000 in June 2019 before pulling back.The price of Bitcoin corrected from the $11,200 to $11,400 range three times in the past three days. Metrics that suggest Bitcoin’s rally is overheated are insufficient on their own. But when combined with a relevant market structure, the argument for a bearish scenario could strengthen.Historically, there has been lackluster resistance between $11,500 and $14,000. Hence, the chances that sellers would attempt to defend the $11,200 to $11,400 resistance range remain high.When buyers break through the strong resistance area, the likelihood of bigger uptrend increases. Trader Michael van de Poppe explained that a breakout above $11,200 could trigger a rally to $11,700. He said:“Crucial threshold is still the $11,200 level. Breaking through and $11,500-11,700 is next!”Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the chief technical officer at Glassnode, raised a similar concern. Pinpointing historical BTC price cycles, he said:“‘We will never see BTC below $10,000 again’, Episode 13. Last episode lasted one day.”Meanwhile, popular Bitcoin trader filbfilb suggests that BTC/USD may be forming a Wyckoff pattern, which typically results in a steep downtrend. Although the viability of the Wyckoff formation is contested, when combined with other metrics, the probability of a distribution phase rises.A potential Wyckoff pattern forming on a lower time frame chart of Bitcoin.

In technical analysis, the H&S pattern is a widely-recognized as a signal for a market top. The trader said:“Everyone talking about BTC ripping higher when it's painting the cleanest H&S in its history?”The momentum of Bitcoin seems to be on the side of buyers, as it repeatedly tests a key resistance level.

Get on board.”The podcaster, most likely aware that many of his 200 million or so listeners (triple the listeners of Alyssa Milano according to the actress) may not be familiar with the term “sats,” speculated on who Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto really was: “I don’t even know if that’s their real name. It’s one of those weird things where the Internet has always tried to figure out who it is.” Rogan has previously stated his podcast doesn’t necessarily need ads from Cash App, which (if true) makes the endorsement at least partly genuine. 🔊🔊""U can automatically purchase bitcoin,daily,weekly or even bi-weekly,known in the industry as stacking sats,sats is short for satoshi..#Bitcoin is a transformational digital currency that acts as a decentralized P2P payment network..I love it""- @joerogan h/t @hodlonaut 🔊🔊 pic.twitter.com/vockwDqLbkCash App, the payment service developed by Square, has given users the option to buy and sell BTC since 2018.

156,"Data from Bitcoin (BTC) marketplace Paxful shows a huge surge of interest in cryptocurrency peer-to-peer trading in Russia, with 350% growth on a year-over-year (YoY) basis.According to the study, from the period of May 2019 to May 2020, Paxful is now seeing an average monthly trading volume of $4M in Russia. The company says that this number “exceeds expectations,” together with the YoY usage increase figures.The last three-months saw a 42% increase, with May recording the best monthly performance amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus is one of the major drivers of growth according to Paxful.Speaking with Cointelegraph, Ray Youssef, CEO of Paxful, provided his thoughts on the reasons behind the spike. He said there was a “strong belief in the future of cryptocurrency” combined with a “lack of trust that some may experience within their traditional financial systems.”“COVID-19 also brought about a wave of financial insecurity globally, which contributed to more peer-to-peer interactions within the crypto sector.”Youssef recalled the experience of Russians during the economic downturn in 1998, when people tried to withdraw cash unsuccessfully, as “the banks seemed to have dried up.” A turn to BTC could “be to offset any economic damages” that could occur due to the pandemic, he said.Anton Kozlov, Paxful’s manager for the Russian market, added that Russia has “always had a monolithic banking system,” which is encouraging citizens to look for alternative ways to participate in the financial markets such as crypto P2P trading.Recently, a branch of the Russian federal government published a draft of new litigation called On Digital Financial Assets, which is focused on enforcing strict cryptocurrency laws in the country.

157,"As Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to its 2020 high of $11,392 this week, its correlation with gold increased and at the moment, BTC’s monthly correlation with gold on daily returns sits at 0.66, according to data from CryptoCompare. The correlation started to increase as gold broke through $1,900, nearing a new high before pulling back alongside Bitcoin. The increase in correlation represents a trend shift as the relationship between the two had previously been falling according to data from Kraken exchange's research team.BTC monthly correlation on daily returns. Source: CryptoCompareWhile the correlation between gold and Bitcoin has surged, Ether’s (ETH) correlation with Bitcoin started to decrease around the same time and the figure now sits at 0.56. CryptoCompare research analyst James Li told Cointelegraph:“With innovations and hype around DeFi, we started to see prices decouple within the crypto space. Ethereum is an enabler and we saw a much stronger gain over the last few weeks, alongside gains from other DeFi tokens.”Often referred to as “digital gold”, Bitcoin’s correlation with the precious metal may further cement its position as a store of value asset at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to pass yet another coronavirus stimulus bill. Li noted that while previous correlations between Bitcoin and gold led to surges in the BTC price, the context has certainly changed. Li elaborated by saying:“Last time Bitcoin had a moderate correlation with gold (around 0.5) was towards the end of 2018. That was when a month earlier in November 2018 bitcoin suffered a 50% drop (at the height of the bitcoin cash war) and made some subsequent rebounds. Gold was recovering from a somewhat cyclical drop a couple of months earlier. The moderate correlation back then was perhaps a bit of a coincidence.”As the dollar and the economy continue to struggle with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems likely that store of value assets like Bitcoin and gold will continue to be in high demand."
158,"RRMine Global CEO, Steve Tsou, said at a Cointelegraph China Great Bay Area International Blockchain Week pre-event interview on July 29 that the future of crypto mining will transit from labor-intensive companies to technology-intensive and capital-intensive companies. It will be all about computing power.With the rapid development of new generation information technologies such as 5G, big data and cloud computing, the demand for computing power will likely increase. Tsou believes that a computing power revolution is imperative. He continued: “Therefore, as a new infrastructure industry in the new market, computing power will play the role of ""engine"" in the digital economy and will grow rapidly. This is a vast blue ocean market, which can accommodate multi-dimensional competition. Both enterprises and individuals can develop their strengths in capital, technology, supply chain, resources, market and other aspects according to their own advantages, playing a role in the appropriate track to join the trend of the time.”Computer power also has financial attributes, according to Tsou, so the introduction of financial technology and innovation of technology is an unavoidable challenge and opportunity for the platform.Tsou argues that there are risks in any industry. The core risks in the crypto mining business involve sufficient preparation for products, strategies and tactics, market predictions, and effective hedging methods. He explained that: “It needs global deployment and large-scale anti-risk capability, which requires enterprises to have sufficient technical strength and global deployment to adapt to the rules of IPFS mainnet and its economic model. Then, the core mining pool technology is required to ensure a stable block generation rate and stable output at unit cost of computing power.”Tsou concluded that mining today is more centralized than before. It is an inevitable trend, he believes. He explained that: “But this kind of centralization is after decentralization and I call it ""weak centralization."" This is centralized relative to individuals, while it is a more healthy and sound decentralization regarding the entire network. It can be defined as jointed individuals in the form of a tribal federation, which also reflects the characteristics of blockchain and is more in line with the development trend of real human society.”"
159,"Ampleforth (AMPL) is a cryptocurrency built with an elastic supply that expands and contracts depending on demand. According to its co-founder Evan Kuo, the team was trying to learn from the failures of the gold standard and Bitcoin (BTC) to create a more flexible monetary system.Although many in the crypto space perceive the finite inelastic supply of Bitcoin and gold as a major advantage over fiat, Kuo disagrees:“The only problem with gold arises when you start to use it as a base money or building block as part of a financial infrastructure.”Since Kuo perceives Bitcoin as digital gold, the same problems apply. As demand goes up, the price increases and if in addition to that, the population expects future price increases, they start hoarding the asset. This leads to a deflationary spiral. Ampleforth is designed with an elastic, automatically adjustable supply. Once a day, the supply either gets automatically expanded or contracted depending on the level activity in the past 24 hours.The total supply is also adjusted, although each holder’s proportional stake does not vary. The equilibrium price target is set to one 2019 Consumer Price Index adjusted dollar. Kuo acknowledged that it is unlikely that AMPL will become a stablecoin in the near future:“And so it is true that we do have this price target and is also true that in the long run, this will potentially become much more stable. But it's not at all a near-term goal or measure of success.”According to Kuo, one of the main goals of this design was to create an asset that would be uncorrelated with traditional assets and Bitcoin. Although historically, Bitcoin and other crypto assets have exhibited low correlations with traditional assets, every major crypto has been tracing Bitcoin’s path. This presents a challenge to crypto investors as it is impossible to achieve diversification with highly correlated assets.Correlation between Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies. Source: Coin Metrics.We calculated a simple Pearson correlation between the prices of Bitcoin and AMPL and it stands at 0.1, which is very weak.One interesting outcome of Ampleforth’s design is that an investor needs to assess their investments differently. AMPL has the potential to compound gains and losses.Let’s say an investor owns 10 AMPL that they acquired for $1 each, making their portfolio worth $10. The price then increases by 10% to $1.10, while the supply expands by 10%, increasing the investor’s holdings to 11 AMPL. The value of the investor’s holdings increase to $12.10One possible strategy would be to “front run” the daily adjustment by analyzing the data and anticipating the direction of the upcoming change. Kuo admitted that this could be a viable strategy, but it is not without its caveats:“You also have to remember that everyone else also has the data themselves, so it's game theoretic. And yes, that strategy certainly is a good strategy. I mean, it's an interesting strategy. [...] But it is not without risk because you're making a bet.”Kuo believes that AMPL (which he calls “oracalized money”) may present new opportunities to the DeFi space because of its unique properties. These opportunities do not have to be limited to Ethereum (ETH); according to Kuo, the team has considered AMPL a “multi-chain” asset from the beginning.Updated: This article was updated on July 30 to reflect that AMPL’s supply goes up as its price goes up."
160,"In July 2016, a mere four years ago, Nvidia was a $26-billion company focused on GPU chips and graphic card production. In comparison, the long-standing sector leader was Intel Corp, with a $166-billion market capitalization. The nearly 40-year old chip manufacturer was a blue-chip Fortune 500 company and at the time, it was likely unfazed by such a small competitor.Nvidia’s previous peak market capitalization occurred in October 2007 as its value approached $22 billion. After the 2008 financial crisis, the stock collapsed over 80% and took nine years to recover. Ether (ETH) faced a similar struggle in 2018 after peaking at $138 billion market capitalization, and has yet to retake its glory days.Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) market capitalizations. Source: KoyfinBesides resembling a similar market capitalization to current Ether’s $35 billion, Nvidia shares traded $10 billion in monthly volume back in 2016, compared to Ether’s current $13 billion transparent volume, according to data from Messari.The graphics chipmaker brand became known worldwide after the Compute Unified Device Architecture, or CUDA, launched in 2006. CUDA is basically a parallel computing platform and API model. Similarly, Ether stood out from Bitcoin (BTC) by creating multiple layers on its blockchain and allowing additional processing capabilities.Nvidia CUDA architecture. Source: QuoraEthereum 2.0 architecture. Source: HackernoonAs shown above, both Nvidia multiple-layer CUDA architecture and Ethereum 2.0 proposed parallel processing shards. Instead of competing with Intel’s CPU processing power and dominance, in 2016, Nvidia launched a supercomputer designed to train deep-learning models based on eight of its higher-end GPUs using a single Intel Xeon CPU. Yes, a competitor item was bundled within Nvidia’s product.Similar to Nvidia’s strategy, instead of emulating the leader’s qualities, Ethereum is taking an approach to capitalize on its differences. Less than three months ago, Vitalik Buterin proposed a DEX-bridge solution to provide easy movement between the Bitcoin and Ethereum network.By dissecting the Ethereum 2.0 core solution, one will find that it exaggerates current differences to Bitcoin. Ethereum 2.0 is increasing the number of independent layers, further reducing each node’s capacity to validate the entire processing power.The same can be said by Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) ERC-20 token, operated by a decentralized autonomous organization. Meanwhile, solutions running in the Ethereum decentralized finance ecosystem have been mimicking the success of Compound and MakerDAO, using Bitcoin, supposedly a competitor.The Ethereum team seems unconcerned with competing with Bitcoin to become the top best store of value solution or means of payment. The upcoming proof-of-stake migration is further evidence that Ethereum is using a strategy similar to the one Nvidia used. It is mathematically impossible to determine the valid chain without an additional source of trust, according to a Cornell University study.Ending the Ethereum-mining era might mark the definitive rupture between Bitcoin and the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The two very different products will most likely no longer be appraised by the same valuation metrics after the complete Ethereum 2.0 makeover.Almost every choice presents an opportunity cost, and this holds especially true in technology. More robust integrated processors could have easily absorbed graphic GPU markets. For example, last month, Apple announced that it would be designing its CPU, hinting that it could also enter GPU production markets.Besides increasing competition from other native smart contract blockchains such as Tron and EOS, Ethereum has hurdles from its major network upgrade. Even if everything goes as planned in terms of scalability, security and PoS incentives, there’s no guarantee that decentralized applications, smart contract developers and users will follow along with these upgrades.As Ethereum’s proof-of-work incentives get reduced and eventually extinguished, it will undoubtedly fuel smaller projects that use compatible mining equipment, such as Ethereum Classic and Haven Protocol.Ethereum undoubtedly holds the largest active number of developers, besides a growing DApps ecosystem. Meanwhile, the development activity of its competitors, EOS and Tron, has recently plummeted.More recently, Ethereum finally flipped Bitcoin, becoming the most used blockchain. Such an impressive feat was fueled by the DeFi sector and ERC-20 stablecoin transactions.Ether’s recent surge above $300 to its highest level in 11 months further proves that the strategy seems to be successfully playing out. Whether it will be able to replicate Nvidia and finally surpass the long-standing sector leader in a couple of years remains an open question.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

161,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a division of the United States Treasury that supervises banking in the country, on July 22, issued an interpretive letter clarifying that nationally chartered banks are allowed to provide cryptocurrency custody services to their customers extended to storing cryptographic keys associated with the currencies. In its letter, the OCC recognizes the current need for banks and other financial service providers to leverage blockchain technology and provide related services to their customers. In addition to national banks, this permission extends to state banks and to loans/savings associations, also known as “thrifts.”Most notably, this move, combined with the news of an expected $2-trillion Fed stimulus, has pushed Bitcoin’s (BTC) price over the $11,000 mark. However, the outcome may not be just short term. Highlighting the significance of this move, Hong Fang, the CEO of OKCoin — a global cryptocurrency exchange — told Cointelegraph:“The OCC has made an important milestone by allowing traditional banks to provide custodial services that will apply to crypto, thereby strengthening the overall financial system and broadening financial inclusion. While the public letter didn’t introduce new regulations, it added much-needed clarification in regard to national banks providing cryptocurrency custody services.”According to Fang, the latest decision is heavily influenced by the acting comptroller of the currency, Brian Brooks — the former chief legal officer of the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. His experience in legal, compliance and government-related functions has equipped him to further the understanding of custodial aspects of cryptocurrency in the U.S. financial system: “The safety-focused remarks by Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks will help enable the U.S. to remain a leader in the global financial landscape.”A development like this is highly impactful on institutional investors who are often skeptical of new industries like crypto. It’s a step toward crypto assets being considered a legitimate asset class by the big banks, payment companies and clearing agencies. Sam Wyner, a co-lead of cryptoasset services at KPMG, discussed the impact of this announcement on institutional investors with Cointelegraph, alluding to the nature of custodians:“Custody is a fees-based business and regulatory support behind a new fees-based business makes it that much more desirable. The institutional crypto markets continue to grow in size, maturity and sophistication, driving the need for custody services. Uncertainty in the market further increases the appeal of a net-new fees-based product offering.”Leading global banks in the U.S. already have a robust underlying infrastructure and systems in place for a traditional custodian business, and crypto can share that base according to Wyner, who further added: “Building out the infrastructure for crypto now will enable banks to support tokenized assets in the future.”Considering the custody fee opportunities that this move brings, institutional players are bound to be the biggest benefactors. The trickle-down impact of this increase in interest is inevitably going to affect retail investors, enabling them to increase the proportion of crypto assets in their individual portfolios. Here, Fang stated further: “I look forward to seeing more banks becoming more open to crypto, with potentially better banking channels, more public awareness, as well as more regulatory clarity. A better user experience ultimately wins.”The largest institutional crypto exchange, Bakkt, has smashed its daily BTC Futures volumes records twice in the past 2 days and BTC options volume hitting an all-time high on Deribit could also be telling signs of this interest picking up. However, a clear trend still needs to be established before any judgement is made.Earlier this year, 40 German banks reached out to regulators, expressing interest in custody licenses for crypto assets, and Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, or BaFin, also released guidance in March that says that firms may only be called custodians if they have access to customers’ private keys, which could eliminate providers that see encrypted keys. Despite this interest, the CEO of Crypto Storage AG said that the company found it extremely hard to even open a bank account in the country due to the banks not understanding the nature of the crypto industry.Similarly in the U.S., it is highly possible that banks might not immediately lunge at the opportunity since, technically, banks were never prohibited to custody crypto assets, and there was never any transparency on the risks that might entail. From this perspective, such a development can be considered as only a clarification from the OCC. Alex Batlin, the founder and CEO and founder of Trustology — a custodial wallet provider — told Cointelegraph that he expects some latency, adding: “For anyone active in this space, it’s just an affirmation of what’s there. For those not active in the past, it could prompt some movement, but it may take some time for the consciousness to evolve.”Adding to the lack of clarity on behalf of the Treasury Department, there have been barriers in the past that have added enormous costs for organizations. For example, Fidelity did offer custodial services for crypto assets, but there was always an issue around mixing normal business activities with crypto due to the lack of clarity if the same organization was allowed to do both. “Now that the greenlight is official, in principle, one of the things it should do is reduce the cost of entering this line of business, it’s easier to do so because there are less hurdles,” according to Batlin. Referring to the risk-averse nature of the banks and large scale institutional investment vehicles, he further stated:“Banks are very risk-conscious. So, when you have them looking at a proposal, and there is lack of regulation, why would you risk your license for something that will yield pretty low returns in the next couple of years? I think there will be demand whether it’s on the lower end or whether it’s sufficient for the likes of BNY and others.”Cryptocurrency exchanges could use this change to have collaborative relationships with banks in order to enable better future prospects for the industry, fuel liquidity and improve the user experience. Wyner elaborated that crypto firms may start taking advantage of banking products to fast track growth, further adding: “This will likely impact exchanges’ roadmaps on how they build products and integrate non-custodial services that better enable market liquidity and access to staking and governance service offerings.” Batlin believes exchanges could start leveraging banks in this scenario to serve their customers:“Exchanges will now be able to leverage banks as custodians and streamline on-ramp and off-ramp payments where banks were once reticent participants. In short, opportunity for them to drive a better user experience and open up crypto to be a mainstream payment mechanism.”Investors in the U.S. would be able to realize enhanced experiences while engaging with crypto assets when their existing banks enable them to track and interact with these assets on their established platforms for e-banking and digital commerce. Looking beyond similar short term and long term lucrative outcomes of this move, Wyner stated:“The increased competition for custody services in the long term may drive new innovation and lower prices. In the short term, however, there is the potential for increased fee structures, limitations on the types of supported crypto assets and decreased ability to access best price execution across liquidity pools.”This move might not be good news for all in the business. Established crypto custody firms like Coinbase, Blockchain.com and Trustology may be highly skeptical due to the economies of scale already achieved by the banks in the traditional custody business. These custody firms would have two options in either competing and/or integrating with these banks by using external wallets and ordering routing systems to maintain strong liquidity. Wyner believes that “there is new competition and they will need to consider differentiating themselves in capabilities and fees against new market entrants,” adding: “At the same time, mature crypto custodians with proven capabilities continue to be desirable to the market.”"
162,"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC, is asking people to remain cautious about celebrity-endorsed Bitcoin (BTC) scam sites.According to the commission’s public warning, the Australian watchdog has received a number of reports of fraudulent crypto sites that claim to be endorsed by prominent businesses, new sites, and government agencies. Some even appear to have the endorsement of national celebrities like Waleed Aly, Mike Baird, Dick Smith, and Virginia Trioli.The ASIC outlined a number of examples as part of their warning. One example, Bitcoin Evolution, is a fake crypto trading bot. The scam’s website has been reported by other countries as well, including the Philippines and Malta. Other similar scams operate under the names Bitcoin Revolution and Bitcoin Trader.The Australian watchdog commented:“These websites are advertised using fake celebrity endorsements, which appear on social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter. When an investor clicks on the article or ad, they are often sent to a ‘mirror site’ – a fake version of a legitimate news site such as ABC News.”The ASIC explained that fraudsters combine online search terms to generate fake news articles and ads on social media, which contains fake endorsements of celebrities or media outlets.Online search engines and news sites often republish those articles or ads, perpetuating excitement and interest in the cryptocurrency. This leads to a purchasing frenzy, said the watchdog. They added:“As more people buy into the cryptocurrency, its value rises ('pumps' up) and other traders latch on, further boosting its price. The scammers then sell ('dump') their own share in the now-overvalued cryptocurrency. This causes its value to plummet, along with any hope for victims of recovering their initial investment.”Australians recently filed 1,810 reports of cryptocurrency-related scams in 2019, collectively totaling more than $21.6 million AU ($14.9 million USD).According to a study by Scamwatch, an arm of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, younger Australians aged 25 to 34 were most heavily affected by crypto investment scams."
163,"An instant crypto exchange says it has launched a new platform that aims to help newcomers bridge the gap between basic investing and active trading.Changelly PRO’s objective is to deliver simplicity to crypto trading — as well as competitive fees and 24/7 support.The new product comes five years after Changelly’s launch. Since 2015, the company has gone from strength to strength. Now, its exchange has over 160 cryptocurrencies listed.Eric Benz, the CEO of Changelly, described PRO as a “natural progression” for the brand’s product portfolio, adding: “Five years ago, our target audience included mainly crypto newcomers that chose to swap a few crypto pairs several times a month gaining on volatility of the market. Since then, the audience and the market have significantly matured.”Changelly notes that those who use its PRO platform will unlock access to a range of features. As well as access to dozens of markets, they’ll benefit from an interactive and customizable terminal that can be configured in line with their personal preferences. Coins can be stored securely in a multicurrency wallet, and low withdrawal fees are offered across the most popular cryptocurrencies. Better still, the registration process is simple — with customer service and educational resources provided.PRO’s launch comes after customer research by the platform showed that 50% of its customers use custodial exchanges for short-term trading. That’s a substantial rise from the 10% reported in 2015, which was when Changelly first launched.“Launching our own spot exchange answers the demands of our community who has been clearly requesting more advanced trading services,” Benz explained.According to Changelly, its goal has been to provide a one-stop-shop for everyone engaging with crypto — irrespective of whether they’re inexperienced users or seasoned traders. The company’s core product serves as an intermediary between exchanges and users, so dozens of digital assets can be swapped with ease in under 10 minutes. This service is available on the go through the specially created Changelly app, alongside an intuitive website for desktop users.PRO is described as a fully compliant, regulated and easy-to-use platform where the customer’s needs come first. High limits remove any unnecessary hurdles for those who wish to place large orders — and fast execution means trades are settled in line with their expectations.Over the years, Changelly has gotten into business with a series of crypto brands. As reported by Cointelegraph, one such partnership came in June when the company teamed up with Freewallet to ensure that crypto transactions could be completed in under three minutes — irrespective of how much congestion there is on the network.Back in April, Changelly also announced plans to launch a fiat-to-crypto marketplace that enables users to handpick offers from reputable fiat providers, meaning they can snap up digital assets at the best possible rate in three short, simple steps. This innovation was driven by a belief that needless complications and high fees may actually have been putting off people from getting involved.As Benz explained at the time: “Changelly’s mission has always been to provide customers with the easiest and fastest way to buy and swap crypto. Two years ago, we became the first to introduce credit and debit cards to purchase crypto and, in so doing, paved the way for others to launch similar services. With the more fiat options becoming available we felt it best for our customers to have a tool, which provides all the best rates from different fiat partners we work with.”Disclaimer.

164,"The latest on-chain data from July 30 suggests miners are preparing to sell Bitcoin (BTC). According to data analytics resource Glassnode, miners’ outflows to exchanges increased significantly in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin miners to exchange flow rise by 46.5%. Source: GlassnodeThere are three possible reasons the miner to exchange flow might not largely affect Bitcoin’s price. First, the potential sell-off from miners coincides with the rejection of Bitcoin at $11,400. Second, while a 46.5% increase seems significant, this is only $94,000 at current BTC prices. Given that the Bitcoin exchange market reportedly processes $24 billion per day, it is not a relatively significant amount of BTC. Third, some market commentators say the short-term market structure of BTC alongside strengthening fundamentals paint an optimistic picture.On July 28, the price of Bitcoin peaked at $11,400 across many exchanges. Since then, BTC dropped to as low as $10,800, marking a 5% drop.According to data from ByteTree, miners sold around 510 BTC more than what they mined in the last seven days. In one week, miners produced 6,556 BTC and sold 7,060, recording a minor negative net inventory.Given that the price of Bitcoin already fell by 5% in the past 48 hours, there is a high probability that the market likely priced in the miner sell-off. If that is the case, this extra supply is unlikely to affect BTC/USD in the near-term.Additionally, the 500 BTC net spend is not high relative to the usual net spend of miners in most weeks. Miners likely sold slightly more BTC to cover expenses, but that could mean lower net spend in the upcoming weeks.Historical data shows miners often sell most of the Bitcoin they mine regularly. For example, a 500 BTC sell order in the exchange market, which equates to $5 million, is not relatively high or uncommon.Meanwhile, traders see a positive near-term trend for Bitcoin due to its recovery from the recent dip. After BTC declined to $10,800, it rebounded quickly back above $11,000.Initially, BTC saw a breakdown from the $11,200 to $11,400 resistance range. The recovery to $11,000 and a strong hourly candle could sway the momentum, according to recent technical analysis.The hourly chart of Bitcoin shows a minor recovery. Source: Jonny MoeJonny Moe, a Bitcoin trader, noted:“If you caught shorts on the wedge breakdown, this is the kind of hourly candle that should make you consider covering.”The market bias around Bitcoin is seemingly swaying bullish. Data from Binance Futures suggests 58% of “top traders” on the platform are holding long positions on BTC.While the market remains majority long, the price action has cooled down since earlier this week. Funding rates of perpetual futures contracts, across the board, have declined. That suggests the market is less overheated, and traders see a favorable market structure in the short-term.Moreover, despite the miner to exchange flow uptick, the amount of BTC held on exchanges has dropped to the lowest levels since right before the summer 2019 bull run. Thus, the confluence of a decent-size pullback, a neutral futures market, and a relatively small miner sell-off could sustain Bitcoin’s momentum."
165,"China, one of the world’s most strict jurisdictions for cryptocurrency trading, has not completely banned Bitcoin (BTC), a local non-profit arbitration organization says.According to a July 30 report published by the Beijing Arbitration Commission (BAC), China's prohibition of Bitcoin is more nuanced than some have suggested.In the report, the BAC clarified China's legal stance on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and outlined major crypto-related activities that are prohibited by the government. According to the BAC, China prohibits token funding and trading platforms from engaging in exchanges between the legal tender and virtual currency or tokens.The commission then states that the same law that bans cryptocurrency as money, recognizes it as a virtual commodity. Furthermore, existing laws are, according to the BAC, not specific enough to regulate Bitcoin as virtual property:""The ""General Principles of Civil Law"" do not make specific provisions on the extension and connotation of virtual property, but only stipulates that the protection of virtual property must be stipulated by law, and the specific protection measures of virtual property are entrusted to other laws. As the country currently has no laws on Bitcoin, it cannot be recognized as a virtual property.""""In summary, the state does not prohibit Bitcoin's activities as virtual commodities, except for the activities that Bitcoin is engaged in as legal tender,"" the report adds.Additionally, since Bitcoin does not constitute money in China — as the government has not approved Bitcoin as a legal tender — and since Bitcoin is not used as an alternative to the legal tender or fiat currency, it should not be associated with an illegal transaction, the BAC said:“The prohibited transactions include those when Bitcoin is used as a currency. If Bitcoin does not engage in activities as a currency, it is not a transaction prohibited by the state. For example, in the equity transfer contract dispute decided by the Shenzhen International Arbitration Court, the two parties agreed on the return of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is only used as a general property. Therefore, the transaction does not violate relevant national regulations and should be valid.”China has emerged as one of the most strict countries in terms of crypto after regulations on local cryptocurrency exchanges back in 2017. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, which was originally established in China, had to leave the country due the regulations.However, despite moving towards tighter regulation of Bitcoin, China has not prohibited the cryptocurrency outright. In November 2019, Chinese authorities reportedly said that Bitcoin mining will not be an illegal industry in the country. The Chinese government is known for its “blockchain, not Bitcoin” approach as President Xi Jinping called on the country to prioritize blockchain development in late 2019.Alongside aggressive blockchain developments like China’s national Blockchain Service Network, China’s central bank has been progressing with its central bank digital currency. In April 2020, China successfully piloted the project in four cities including Shenzhen, Chengdu, Suzhou and Xiongan."
166,"Dash recently claimed it had been the world’s safest cryptocurrency for a year due to its innovative technology called ChainLocks that allegedly makes a 51% attack nearly impossible. Fully implemented in early July 2019, ChainLocks has not yet seen any protocol capable of matching it — according to the Dash Core team. Well-known Bitcoin (BTC) educator Andreas Antonopoulos recently suggested that with the Bitcoin blockchain, a 10-minute 51% attack would cost around $1 billion — something that sounds unrealistic to achieve. But what makes Dash’s ChainLocks blockchain supposedly more secure, and what is the importance of this technology for the industry as a whole?A 51% mining attack is possible when a miner, or group of malicious miners, has more hashing power at its disposal than the combined hashing power of all other miners on the network. Ultimately, it gains leverage to steal coins, cancel transactions and disrupt the operability of the network.Experts from Cornell University believe that if the conventional assumptions underlying the proof-of-work consensus algorithm are valid, then 51% mining attacks are not a problem for blockchains such as Bitcoin. It is more beneficial to be honest rather than engage in malicious behavior. Another assumption is that most of the hashing power comes from rational participants. However, there are situations when these assumptions can be invalid. If, for example, the development of new ASIC mining devices remained secret or members of mining pools colluded to make additional profit, the distribution of hashing power could shift, making an attack beneficial for individuals or at least cutting losses to an acceptable level.Large networks, such as the Bitcoin platform, are the least exposed to a 51% attack, as the cost of acquiring more than half of the computing power outweighs the potential profit. However, smaller projects such as Ethereum Classic (ETC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could be attacked more easily. For example, Bitcoin Cash is not dominated by a particular hashing algorithm to resist a 51% attack. Despite the fact that Bitcoin Cash uses the SHA256D algorithm, which is also used by Bitcoin, its hashing power is less than 5% of that of Bitcoin. This leads to distrust in the PoW algorithm, as demonstrated by the 2019 hash wars seen in the Bitcoin Cash community.On the other hand, while larger networks are less vulnerable to the risk of being hacked, even Bitcoin has an attack cost — although it is so high that such manipulation becomes unprofitable. According to data from analytics firm Messari, the cost of a successful 51% attack on the Bitcoin blockchain in January would have been more than $21 million per day. As of publication, data shows that the cost of a one-hour attack has decreased to roughly $468,995 per hour, or $11.3 million per day.Even assuming that an attacker has the required amount of money, it’s not so easy to attack the Bitcoin network. First of all, an attacker will need to purchase or accumulate a colossal amount of mining equipment. Buying new equipment is challenging, as producers’ capacities and equipment are booked for months or even years in advance. So, an attacker would need to quietly set up its own production and outstrip the Chinese producers. The largest existing ASIC miner manufacturers are unlikely to be involved in attempting such an attack since it would completely destroy their business model of selling the mining machines.Additionally, given that the goal of the Bitcoin network is to be decentralized in which the share of each individual miner is small, it would be extremely difficult to combine capacities, as that would require significant time and monetary expenses.Dash’s ChainLocks claims to add a new layer of security that other blockchains have never had. The main idea is to minimize the risks of the centralization of the Dash network if its blockchain comes under the control of a large number of the miners.The common theory is that if miners take over a network, it will be noticed, as block production will grow. However, attackers can do so privately and instead of producing blocks one by one, produce their own secret chain. Hence, the network will first assume that everything is working as usual — then suddenly undergo a reorganization.ChainLocks checks how fast blocks are being mined. Previously, this validation process could take up to one hour, but with the introduction of a new feature called Long-Living Masternode Quorums, or LLMQs, it can take just a few seconds. LLMQs use masternodes to lock new blocks and protect the network against a split or double-spending, making the validated transactions irreversible. The value of ChainLocks lies in the fact that it’s no longer necessary to wait for six or more confirmations for the transaction to be confirmed.Related: Bitcoin Double Spends an Inevitable Network Feature Legitimate or NotFernando Gutierrez, chief marketing officer of Dash Core Group, noted that while Bitcoin and other blockchains rely on implemented checkpoints at preset intervals, ChainLocks adds a second security layer, telling Cointelegraph:""Bitcoin is extremely secure in terms of the computing power needed to perform a 51% mining attack. Dash has a much lower threshold at the mining layer, but it obtains arguably higher security by adding a second layer to the security model. Dash’s second and additional layer, ChainLocks, would require the attacker to own more than 20% of the coins in circulation, which makes the attack economically unfeasible.""According to Dash’s director of public outreach, Joël Valenzuela, Dash’s automatic transactions are “more secure in 1.3 seconds than a Bitcoin transaction after hours (if not days) of confirmations on the blockchain.” Analyzing Dash’s blockchain security on his YouTube channel, Andreas Antonopoulos called ChainLocks “a novel and interesting way” to secure the network by combining PoW and proof-of-stake.There are two requirements for double-spending to be able to happen on Dash. First, a malicious participant must gain control of at least 51% of the network hash rate. Second, it would also need to overcome the 60% majority of the masternode network that is required to create quorums and, subsequently, prevent ChainLocks from forming. Speaking of the possible cost of an attack on the Dash blockchain, Mark Mason, trust protector for the Dash DAO Irrevocable Trust, told Cointelegraph: ""In order to disrupt quorum creation and ChainLocks formation, an attacker would need to control more than 40% of the masternode network.” Given that there are currently 5,059 total and 4,912 enabled masternodes on the Dash network each holding 1,000 Dash as per the required amount, 40% of the current enabled masternode network is 1,964,800 Dash or $157.8 million at the time of publication. There is also a cost involved in hosting and running masternodes that would need to be factored in. But due to Dash’s scarcity, with 52.59% of Dash’s current circulating coin supply allocated to the masternode network, there is not enough available supply and liquidity on exchanges to acquire the amount required to perform an attack. Finally, an upward buying pressure will likely render an attack unfeasible in economic terms. Hence, Antonopolous proposed the new term “60% attack,” saying that a 51% attack on Dash is “not feasible”:“In fact, if you want to do a 51% attack, you actually have to do a 60% attack where you either compromise the code running on the masternodes or you put enough stake, which probably wouldn’t be possible, to run 60% of the masternodes yourself.”One of the essential conditions for the successful operation of ChainLocks is the presence of semitrusted nodes that protect the network from a Sybil attack — a type of attack that results in the network connecting only to the nodes controlled by the attacker. A currency that does not have such a class of nodes will not be able to safely implement a secure protocol such as ChainLocks. For example, with Bitcoin, anyone relying on the votes of individual nodes can be tricked by launching thousands of malicious nodes. A solution would require establishing explicit trust in some selected groups of nodes, but this would mean centralization. With Dash, the masternode network is protected from Sybil attacks by a requirement to demonstrate collateral of 1,000 Dash per masternode, which makes it economically impractical to carry out such an attack.The lack of similar solutions in the blockchain security market and the increasing frequency of hash wars may make ChainLocks an appealing technology for platforms with a low level of protection against attacks. In June, blockchain project Zcoin announced its plans to integrate the ChainLocks protocol to increase the network’s resistance to a 51% attack.The ChainLocks protocol has received positive reviews from some blockchain programmers and mathematicians. Darren Tapp, assistant research professor at the Arizona State University’s School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering, conducted a security analysis of the protocol, confirming that it does provide resistance to a 51% attack.While the numbers provided by Dash help bolster its claims that it is a secure blockchain network, the risk of a 51% attack still remains, although it is less likely in comparison with other blockchains. Ariel Zetlin-Jones, associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, told Cointelegraph that the 60% argument could be flawed:“This logic ignores a key consideration which is what an attacker would gain by executing a 51% (or 60%) attack. $20 million sounds like a lot of money, but with Bitcoin’s market cap currently over $110 billion, one could easily envision a user (or group of users) who could stand to gain more than $20 million by implementing the attack. The same logic applies to Dash’s ChainLock solution."""

The latest beneficiary has been the stock price of the renowned camera manufacturer Kodak (KODK) whose stock surged from $2 to $60 in one day. Therefore, given the current climate of economic uncertainty and “infinite QE,” if the optimism around risk-assets flows over to Bitcoin, chances of a similar rally for BTC price — as some analysts are currently predicting — certainly increase.Moreover, following the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting on July 29, strategists expect the overall sentiment of investors to recover, which is good news for Bitcoin bulls given the recent correlation between Bitcoin and stocks.Bitcoin investor reacts to the Kodak rally.

Kodak has been producing materials and chemical products for quite some time. Kodak shifted away from the camera industry in 2013, and President Trump’s message further solidified Kodak’s presence in pharmaceutics. It came after the government decided to decrease the dependence of the U.S. on drug manufacturers in overseas markets.Consequently, Kodak saw a rally that even outperformed the 2017 parabolic uptrend of Bitcoin. In a single trading session, the Eastman Kodak Company stock rose by 318%. It broke through 20 circuit breakers, securing a $1.45 billion market capitalization. At its peak, Kodak surged by 2,198% in 2 days.KODK stock price performance 2017-2020.

168,"As July comes to a close, the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) held by major cryptocurrency exchanges has reached its lowest level since late May 2019. At that time, Bitcoin’s price was around $8,000 before continuing toward its 2019 high of $12,967 on July 11, 2019. The Bitcoin balance held by major exchanges has been dropping significantly since mid-March 2020 following the Black Thursday crash on March 12 and subsequent recovery. There are 2.64 million BTC collectively held on exchanges as of July 29, according to data from Glassnode, a market and on-chain analytics resource. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price continues to climb and recently hitting a yearly high of $11,400Bitcoin exchange balance vs Bitcoin price. Source: GlassnodeAdditionally, markets analytics firm, Arcane Research, noted that decreasing balances on exchanges suggest users are showing more interest in holding their Bitcoin for the long term by withdrawing their BTC from exchanges to control their own private keys directly.This trend means less selling pressure from BTC holders and comes just two months after the 2020 halving that reduced the amount of newly mined Bitcoin in half. Coupled with the recent increase in Tether (USDT) exchange inflows, which have reached their 2020 high yesterday, and overall supply that’s now over $10 billion, the number of digital dollars waiting on the sidelines to potentially buy BTC is bigger than ever.Bitcoin has been looking increasingly attractive lately given its store of value attributes in the face of the inflating U.S. dollar.

Specifically, institutional interest in Bitcoin seems to be picking up at lightspeed as both Bakkt and CME futures have posted record numbers for two consecutive days in volume and open interest. Additionally, Grayscale has added another $1 billion to its funds in just 11 days,  making the total AUM over $5.1 billion across their entire family of products. CME and Bakkt Bitcoin Futures - Total Open Interest and Volumes.

At the same time, government authorities and fintech companies leverage technology to identify transaction attributes and help to expose fraud.Is Bitcoin (BTC) really the preferred method for criminals to carry out money laundering activities?Crypto assets are a digital representation of value that can be traded or transferred digitally and used as a form of payment. Bitcoin is the most popular digital asset used today. In the media, Bitcoin is frequently associated with the infamous Silk Road — the first online modern darknet marketplace — where online users would purchase items like weapons and illegal drugs anonymously. In 2013, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down the market’s first iteration.Mainstream media content on Bitcoin and digital assets focus on criminal activities rather than technology and innovation. Typical rhetoric goes like this: Due to its anonymous nature, Bitcoin can help criminals. Looking deeper into this statement, is Bitcoin the preferred method for criminals to carry out money laundering activities?Another tender for payment is cash. Banks still require traditional identity systems using the least volatile types of user information to wire and transfer money. National boundaries heavily restrict processing times and the transferring of physical currency. Less evident to a typical consumer is that money can be sent from laptops and computers with a couple of clicks, and transfers can be nestled or disguised in a matryoshka-like system of shell companies across strategic jurisdictions.The gatekeepers of our financial system are also associated with money laundering.Globalization means new opportunities to engineer dubious ways to transfer money that take advantage of economic disparity between countries. John Sweeney, a British investigative journalist for the BBC, stated: “It’s bad form to mention money-laundering. Instead, you talk about asset-management structures and tax beneficial schemes.” Banks, the gatekeepers of our financial system, are also associated with money laundering.Financial institutions are repeatedly fined for their failure to uphold strong Anti-Money Laundering laws. HSBC’s $881-million money laundering scandal is just one story that has made its way into the media and has become a Netflix original documentary. Technology and innovation in digital currency promise more efficient, reliable and scalable ways to move and transfer assets in our global economy, but what advances are still needed?2019 was a record year when it comes to the number of fines imposed: Authorities handed out 58 AML penalties, totaling $8.14 billion, double the amount that was imposed in 2018, with 29 fines totaling $4.27 billion. U.S. regulators were the most aggressive, imposing 25 penalties totaling $2.29 billion, and the United Kingdom followed second with 12 fines totaling $388.4 million, according to a recent report.Two-thirds of AML penalties were imposed on banks, while approximately 17% were given to organizations in the gaming, gambling and cryptocurrency sectors. These industries are subject to closer scrutiny from regulators, as they are common channels for money laundering.AML penalties have been growing since 2015. The average fine was $145.33 million in 2019. In 2020, we have already seen two penalties over $1 billion, the largest being a $5.1-billion penalty issued by the French government.The emergence of new tools to tackle AML is commonly scrutinized by regulators before gaining acceptance. In 2019, stronger AML regulations were established concerning money and digital assets such as cryptocurrency. In spite of this, the crypto sphere will continue to grow.The Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, an intergovernmental organization, was founded in 1989 to combat money laundering. It has released crypto guidance for many countries where regulators urged caution around bank compliance. Hong Kong recommended banks to adopt a risk-based approach to the sector. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury, pushed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, urging banks to report suspicious activity related to digital currency including cryptocurrency.Singapore, Japan and South Korea are also set to launch a cryptocurrency regulatory framework later in 2020. Meanwhile, banks have been taking significant steps to de-risk the entire crypto sector. The FATF made clear that this de-risk approach is not sustainable in the long term because the cryptosphere will continue to grow. Therefore, avoiding exposure will be impractical.As a new adoption, businesses will be expected to monitor and assess the financial risks related to the use of digital currencies.With new technology comes new adoption. 2020 is set to be the year where greater regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies will be provided. India, Japan, South Korea and France have granted more favorable legislation to the public concerning crypto this year. These actions have been driving discussions within government circles about establishing a central bank digital currency, its regulation and monetary authority or law.The emergence of projects such as Libra, a permissioned blockchain digital currency proposed by Facebook, would require regulators to keep pace with innovation and achieve a greater understanding of the latest technology and its implications. Businesses will be expected to monitor and assess the financial risks related to any use of digital currencies as a new adoption.Criminals paid in cryptocurrency need to receive their final payout in cash. This requires obscuring where their funds come from. Unfortunately, several sophisticated services and tools help criminals do so. After all, if there were no way for bad actors to cash out cryptocurrency that they had received through illegal means, then there would be far less incentive for them to commit crimes in the first place.An example of the money-laundering process:Given its digital nature and inherent characteristics, Bitcoin appears to be appropriate during placement and layering phases. Starting with placement, Bitcoin could be a useful tool to exchange fiat currency to Bitcoin and then Bitcoin again into another fiat currency, moving money from one country to another. However, because most criminals use Bitcoin to receive money, their main issue is integration — that is, putting the illicit funds back in the economy to hide their illegal activity.According to “The Chainalysis 2020 Crypto Crime Report,” many criminals launder their cryptocurrency with the assistance of over-the-counter brokers. OTC brokers are agents or firms that facilitate trades between buyers and sellers who do not want to (or cannot) transact on a cryptocurrency exchange.OTC brokers are common among traders and miners who want to divest of large holdings of crypto assets at a negotiated price, as using an open exchange to sell off large volumes can impact market prices. The majority of OTC traders collaborate with exchanges, but many of them “offer much lower KYC than the exchanges they operate on.” Many of them take advantage of and specialize in providing money-laundering services to criminals. Exchanges are still the preferred way to clean illicit Bitcoin. Throughout 2019, more than $2.8 billion worth of Bitcoin was sent from criminal entities to exchanges, and 52% of it went to the top two exchanges, Binance and Huobi.Bitcoin is more practical for the second phase of money laundering: layering. It is a digital currency that can be used to make purchases across the network without constraints from physical boundaries. If one pays enough attention (and implements privacy-preserving techniques such as the ones we will further explore), it is possible to spend Bitcoin to buy assets or cash it out through OTC traders. For instance, one might purchase a Rolex on a secondary market and then resell it, only this time for fiat money. However, it will be quite hard for criminals to purchase monetary assets since most of them are bought through intermediaries that require compliance with Know Your Customer and AML.However, it is worth pointing out that unlike cash, cryptocurrencies are inherently transparent since all transactions are recorded in a public ledger. As included in the report released by Chainalysis, all these illicit funds leave traces behind them. If one accumulates a significant amount of information, then it becomes possible to identify who is behind the Bitcoin address used to launder money.Bitcoin can be practical for placement and layering when laundering money. However, does it provide a better alternative to the current system? Only 1.1% of the total cryptocurrency volume is deemed to be illicit. The vast majority of crypto-related crimes were scams with transaction volumes totaling more than $8.6 billion. Excluding PlusToken, Bitconnect and OneCoin — the three largest crypto Ponzi schemes — scams have accounted for about 0.46% of all cryptocurrency activity.Based on the preconceived notions of anonymity and identity, the argument that Bitcoin is a better tool to launder money is a misconception. Identities on the Bitcoin blockchain are not anonymous, but rather pseudonymous. Each identity is associated with an alphanumeric string, called a private key. While it is possible to argue that Bitcoin offers a certain level of protection over the identity of users, transactions are actually public.Due to its inherent features, all transactions of a blockchain are shared among peers, whose consensus is required to validate the chronology of transactions. Dave Weisberger, the CEO of CoinRoutes, argued:“The goal of money laundering is to create a chain of transactions that can’t be traced, so since the bitcoin blockchain is designed to have an indelible public record of all transactions, it makes ‘laundering’ much more difficult.”If pseudonymity does not provide enough privacy, then so-called “mixers” can be used. Mixers are software or services that allow users to conduct transactions by mixing their coins with other users to preserve their privacy. This enables users to hide their outputs and their addresses — and their real identities.In 2019, cryptocurrency mixers were front and center on the news cycle with reports with European authorities shutting down services. However, according to the Chainalysis report, mixers appear to be used much more for privacy than illicit activity. Only 8.1% of all mixed coins have been stolen, and only 2.7% of coins mixed had been previously used on darknet markets.Coin mixers are not exactly user-friendly, and they are not yet able to provide the same degree of security as “legacy methods” for money laundering. One person using a mixer might raise red flags, but mixers are only able to hide transactions effectively if a critical mass of Bitcoin is mixed. Furthermore, there are more advanced countermeasures available, such as blockchain analysis, which can tie even mixed Bitcoin to addresses. Unlike cash, every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded in a publicly visible ledger. With the right tools, it is possible to investigate which cryptocurrency activities are associated with crime, gather insights on their obfuscation techniques, and share insights with law enforcement to stop bad apples from abusing the system.These companies have helped legislators by providing valuable intelligence to help with criminal cases. One such case is the recent involvement of Chainalysis in closing the Welcome to Video Website, accused of allowing people to post, share and download minors’ videos to a network of pedophiles. Cash is still the easiest and most secure way of laundering. The United Nations Drugs and Crime Office and Chainalysis both estimate that for each dollar in Bitcoin spent on the dark web, at least $800 is laundered in cash.The data presented suggest that Bitcoin can be an additional tool for criminals to launder money. For example, they may use disposable addresses and techniques of coin mixing as a precaution to ensure an adequate level of privacy protects them. However, pseudonymous identities, public transactions and navigating system complexities required to use Bitcoin do not currently provide a more efficient or effective alternative to launder money. As shown in Chainalysis’ report, a criminal does not want a permanent trace of illicit activities published and shared publicly.Furthermore, Bitcoin cannot accommodate the enormous volume of money that would be needed to be laundered by criminals. The Bitcoin network sees a low daily volume compared to other asset classes — $25 billion on Jan. 27, 2020. Moving such a sum of money would immediately sound the alarm for blockchain forensics companies and would require further intermediaries and centralized exchanges.In 2017 and 2018, the Lazarus Group, a hacking group associated with North Korea, cashed out the majority of its funds through low-KYC exchanges. However, in 2019, the group’s techniques became more sophisticated, as they cleaned half of their funds through CoinJoin wallets (mixers), while the other half still sits idle in their wallets.Law enforcement and regulators need to become experts to improve their ability to “prevent and respond to various forms of crypto crime.” Exchanges are also expected to carry out extensive due diligence on users, OTC trades and any other third party operating on their platform, which still represents the preferred destination to which criminals send their illicit cryptocurrencies.AML regulations are not designed for the current state of things. More international collaboration and oversight are needed to enable freedom of movement of funds and money. Unfortunately, legislations have not been able to keep up with rapid technological advances. For an alternative to our traditional banking systems, new rules and regulations are needed to ensure adequate governance globally.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article was co-authored by Aly Madhavji and Alek Tan.Aly Madhavji is the managing partner at Blockchain Founders Fund which invests in and builds top-tier venture startups.

170,"Iran has announced that it will now allow industrial-scale power plants in the country to operate as Bitcoin miners —- provided they don’t use subsidized fuel.In a statement to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) on July 27, Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, a Deputy Managing Director at Tavanir, Iran's Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution Management Company, said power plants in the country could operate as Bitcoin mines “if they comply with approved tariffs"" and have the necessary licenses.Mashhadi said that any power plant considering such a venture could not use subsidized fuel for crypto mining.""Now we’re in a situation where the supply of electricity is of great importance to the public,” the energy spokesman said. “We will not allow anyone to misuse tariffs provided for the agricultural and industrial sectors to produce Bitcoin while it’s worth more than $9,000.”Cointelegraph reported in January that Iran’s Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade had issued 1,000 licenses for crypto mining since the government authorized it as an approved industrial activity in July 2019.According to the IRNA, a spokesman for the electricity industry said 14 crypto miners in Iran had requested more than 300 megawatt (MW) of power — equivalent to the usage across three provinces in the country.The tariff scheme for crypto miners in Iran is dependent on market factors such as fuel prices in the Middle East. Mining requires a lot of power, but the country’s electricity is very cheap compared to the rest of the world. Mashhadi estimated in 2019 that the production of a single Bitcoin would use only about $1,400 in state subsidies.People who expose illegally operating cryptocurrency mining companies in Iran also receive a bounty of up to 100 million Rials, or $2,375."
171,"Fidelity Digital Assets, subsidiary of multi-trillion dollar investment firm Fidelity Investments, views Bitcoin (BTC) as an “aspirational store of value” and an “insurance policy” against a troubled financial system according to a new report.Fidelity holds over $8 trillion in assets and its digital assets arm launched in October 2018.The report, Bitcoin Investment Thesis: An Aspirational Store of Value, notes that Bitcoin meets the basic test for being considered a store of value but hasn’t achieved that status yet:“Many investors consider Bitcoin to be an aspirational store of value in that it has the properties of a store of value but has yet to be widely accepted as such.”The core components which drive its potential as a store of value lie in the “decentralized settlement network and its digitally scarce native asset”. Bitcoin’s volatility, often used in counter arguments against Bitcoin being a store of value, can be considered beneficial to adoption as it “attracts attention, development and innovation” the report says.According to John Pfeffer of Pfeffer Capital LP, who is quoted in the report: “Most people in the world don’t yet see Bitcoin as digital gold. As soon as people see it in a different way, the price will adjust”.The report also makes reference to the concerns around money printing as a result of the COVID-19 financial crisis and suggests that some are losing trust in traditional economies:“The unknown consequences of record low interest rates, unprecedented levels of global monetary and fiscal stimulus and deglobalization are all adding fuel to the fire of awareness and adoption.”John Vincent of Wakem Capital Management made reference to money printing in light of the recent Bitcoin block reward halving. “You don’t need to be a PhD to understand that the number of dollars just doubled whereas the BTC supply just halved,” he said. Another catalyst for adoption the report notes is the transfer of wealth from the older generation to a younger demographic as “younger people view Bitcoin more favourably”."
172,"With Ethereum’s recent price rise above $300, there are now more ETH addresses in profit than the total number of addresses holding any amount of Bitcoin.Blockchain statistics indicate that the total number of ETH addresses in the green is 31.86 million, whereas the total number with a Bitcoin balance at all is 30.83 million.  The last time Ethereum was priced above $300 was a year ago, and on-chain metrics have improved vastly since then. The findings, as first reported in The Defiant, indicate that millions of new addresses loaded up on ETH below $300. Many of them would have got in below $200 as the asset languished at low levels for March and April.In July 2019, when ETH prices reached a high similar to today’s price, just 13.5 million addresses, or less than 50%, were making a profit. The figures have been derived from a Historical In/Out of the Money (HIOM) indicator which analyzes on-chain positions based on the average token cost for a given address.The number of Ethereum ‘hodlers’, or those holding the asset for over a year, has also increased by 10 million over the past twelve months.Another solid fundamental for the growing use cases of Ethereum is the amount of Bitcoin that has been tokenized on the network.Tokenizing, or wrapping, Bitcoin enables the asset to be used in decentralized finance and with applications that are based on Ethereum and the ERC-20 standard. With the explosive growth of DeFi and yield farming opportunities, BTC holders have not wanted to miss out on the action.As a result, there are now more than 20,000 BTC tokenized on Ethereum. The figure equates to $223 million worth of BTC at today’s prices according to the btconethereum.com. As developer Josh Stark posted, that’s 20 times as much Bitcoin as locked in Lightning and eight times more than in Blockstream’s Liquid. As DeFi continues to grow it’s likely the amount of tokenized Bitcoin will increase."
173,"Since Black Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) has become a better hedge against the U.S. dollar than gold. At the same time, its correlation with the S&P 500 Index reached unprecedented highs.Correlations chart. Source: Coinmetrics.Since the disintegration of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, investors have looked to gold as a hedge against fiat. Gold has consistently exhibited a negative correlation with the dollar with some very rare exceptions, while Bitcoin and the dollar have been uncorrelated with each other until recently.U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Source: Trading Economics.However, starting from the Black Thursday crash in March, Bitcoin has demonstrated a stronger negative correlation with the dollar than gold. The initial twist was caused by Bitcoin losing almost half of its value and the dollar’s appreciation, as investors were fleeing to quality. Soon, the roles reversed. Bitcoin made up the losses it suffered during the meltdown while the dollar has depreciated against its main fiat rivals and gold. The market has discounted the U.S. government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis. High mortality rates, almost 50 million unemployed and unprecedented multi-trillion dollar stimulus packages, have not increased confidence in the nation’s economy in the eyes of the investors. In this inflationary environment, Bitcoin, with its encoded inflation and finite supply, may begin to be perceived as a viable alternative to fiat by more traditional investors. In addition, it presents certain advantages over gold as well, such as aforementioned finite supply and easy instant transferability."
174,"Cameron Winklevoss, the billionaire founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, believes the next Bitcoin (BTC) bull run will be much different. When compared to previous bull markets, Winklevoss noted that there is substantially more capital, infrastructure, and better projects.Winklevoss said:“The next Bitcoin bull run will be dramatically different. Today, there’s exponentially more capital, human capital, infrastructure, and high-quality projects than in 2017. Not to mention the very real specter of inflation that all fiat regimes face going forward. Buckle up!”Various data points hint at a significant increase in the amount of capital held by investors in the cryptocurrency market. Major cryptocurrency exchanges have also received more regulatory clarity, improving the infrastructure of the market.Two metrics primarily show that more money could be involved in the latest Bitcoin rally. First, the market capitalization of Tether (USDT) has surpassed $10 billion. Second, the assets under management (AUM) by Grayscale Investments recently achieved a new high.Tether (USDT) market capitalization hits $10 billion. Source: CoinMarketCapTo date, Tether is the biggest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. Investors, especially in countries with regulatory uncertainty, rely on the stablecoin to trade crypto assets. A rapid rise in the market cap of Tether could indicate more money is waiting to deploy on crypto exchanges.Grayscale’s crypto-asset trusts are arguably the most widely-utilized investment vehicles by institutions to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. Within the last quarter, the assets under management in Grayscale’s suite of products hit an all-time high at $5.1 billion. Grayscale AUM reached $5.1 billion. Source: GrayscaleGrayscale CEO Barry Silbert said:“In 2013, everybody thought we were crazy for launching a Bitcoin investment fund. Well, look at us now…”The confluence of Tether’s market cap and Grayscale’s ballooning assets under management shows that capital held by institutions and retail traders continues to increase substantially.In 2020, exchanges and banks in the U.S. primarily saw regulatory clarity regarding cryptocurrencies. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. (OCC) allows banks to provide and operate crypto custodial solutions. It is essentially a green light for financial institutions in the U.S. to get involved in the cryptocurrency market.JPMorgan is also reported to have accepted Gemini and Coinbase, two of the largest spot exchanges in the U.S., as clients. Through this, the fear of strained banking relationships affecting exchanges and users has subsided.Clarity around cryptocurrencies by major U.S. regulators and banks could improve the perception of the asset class by the mainstream. This means if Bitcoin approaches a new bull market, the improved sentiment around the entire industry could benefit BTC adoption and its value.Overall, projects and companies in both the Bitcoin and crypto markets are seemingly increasing in quality. This is partially due to increased regulatory clarity and the fact that more traditional firms are willing to collaborate with crypto firms. As an example, Bitcoin Lightning startup Zap is working with Visa and has participated in its Fintech Fast Track Program. This allows Zap to launch Visa cards as a part of the partnership. Zap CEO Jack Mallers said:“We're contractually obligated to launch one in the next 12 months and we plan on launching one in the next few months.”Better projects, increased capital, and improving infrastructure are resulting in boosted confidence levels among Bitcoin investors and this is raising sentiment across the entire sector. In the medium-term, high-profile investors are hopeful BTC would reflect these factors.Also, don’t miss our upcoming conference Cointelegraph Crypto Traders Live.

175,"In a Cointelegraph China Great Bay Area International Blockchain Week pre-event interview on July 29, Ben Zhou, CEO of derivative exchange Bybit, argued that the maturity of the derivatives market is the main reason for institutions to enter the crypto space. Zhou says that the biggest concern for any institution exploring crypto is the need for proper financial tools to run risk management. Risk management is out of reach without a functional, robust derivatives market. He stressed that: “Derivatives markets serve a vital function by contributing to liquidity, providing proper risk management tools and different product options. Therefore such is how I see the cause and effect when it comes to this topic.”Although regulation only plays a small part in attracting institutions, Zhou also believes Increased regulatory attention is a positive development and a sign of maturation of the crypto industry as a whole. He added that: “When the bar of play rises, those that are built for the long run and truly provide value for users will emerge as the biggest winners.”Zhou says the recent surge of Bitcoin prices is partially attributable to the increasing demand. This is heralded by the entry of more and more institutional investors, just as the supply dwindles following this year’s halving. He continued that: “The confidence of financial institutions also lends a legitimizing sheen and helps people to see crypto more as money. Continuing improvements in the crypto infrastructure will gradually allow people to do more with the cryptocurrencies, which will in turn grant them more inherent value. There may not be a single event where everyone will all of a sudden agree that crypto has achieved mainstream status. But when we look back to this moment of time some time in the crypto future, we may arrive at the conclusion that in a way the gradual process has already started.”Standing in contrast to the traditional world of finance, cryptocurrencies present people with an alternative approach. This is thanks to their range of innate and systemic strengths, says Zhou. It is important to note that crypto and traditional finance are not diametrically opposed forces. He pointed out that:  “Financial institutions are already facilitating the entry to the crypto world with fiat gateways and providing custodian services. With wider adoption and increasing maturation of cryptocurrencies, we are bound to see more areas of convergence and increasing overlap of the two sectors.”Zhou also revealed plans for the exchange to open more pairs, such as ETH/USDT, BCH/USDT, LTC/USDT, XTZ/USDT, and LINK/ USDT, for derivative trading in the near future."
176,"The on-chain activity for the three of the biggest stablecoins exploded as Bitcoin (BTC) was breaking the $11,000 price barrier.7-day average transfer volume for USDT, DAI, USDC & BTC Price. Source: Glassnode.Several stablecoins, including the market-leading Tether (USDT), have recently experienced a significant growth in market capitalization. We observe that a significant increase in the transfer volume of USDT, DAI (DAI), and USDC (USDC) coincided with the latest Bitcoin bull run. It is not clear from the chart whether this metric can be considered a leading or lagging indicator.The increase in stablecoin transfer volume, unlike the increase in trading volume, is a better representation of the coin’s utilization within the crypto ecosystem. Although no real bull run can happen without the injection of additional fiat, when it comes to Bitcoin trading, stablecoins seem to prevail. It appears that most whale trades are transacted with stablecoins, not with fiat.Earlier today, Tether announced a 300 million USDT swap from TRON (TRX) to Ethereum:Source: Twitter.The company did not provide rationale for the swap, but it is possible that there is a lack of demand on the TRON network."
177,"Crypto terrorists threatened to bomb a government office on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. They told authorities that they would only disable the alleged explosive device if their crypto ransom was paid.According to FNN, the terrorists sent the Numata Town Hall an email stating they had installed a bomb in a women’s second-floor toilet. They claimed that as long as officials met their payment demands before 03:00 UTC on June 29, the bomb would not be detonated. However, this appears to have been a fake threat. The deadline set by the criminals has passed and the hall remains intact without any further suspicious activity as of press time. Authorities stated that the email arrived during the week of July 20.Locals and people working inside the building claim that they did not notice any suspicious movements from strangers. This seems to reinforce suspicions that the crypto scam relied on a terrorist threat as a way to pressure the government into paying the ransom.In other crypto scam cases in Japan, the ongoing pandemic forced the postponement of the Olympic Games in Tokyo.This has triggered a series of online crypto-related scams, including an email from alleged members of the International Olympic Committee. In these emails, scammers ask unsuspecting victims for donations in Bitcoin (BTC) across the country, as Cointelegraph reported on April 30."

Source: Cointelegraph, Glassnode, Etherscan.We compared the total number of addresses created in the first five years on both major blockchain networks.

One reason is that the accounting systems in the two networks are different.Total number of addresses in the first five years of existence Ethereum versus Bitcoin. Source: Cointelegraph, Glassnode, Etherscan.In the first 600 days, the growth rate for both networks is quite similar. By mid-2017, however, Ethereum’s curve became much steeper. The most obvious explanation is the ICO boom. The creation of thousands of ERC20 tokens and their subsequent distribution and trading led to a much greater rate of Ethereum address creation.Another advantage that Ethereum had from the beginning is that it was standing on the shoulders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; whereas Bitcoin was the world’s first decentralized electronic currency. Bitcoin’s adoption was slow and gradual. The slope of its curve never had an uplift similar to the ICO boom.In another five years, a similar comparison will hopefully still remain relevant."
180,"Typically, blockchain exchanges and traditional exchanges, such as the Nasdaq or London Stock Exchange, have been seen as polar opposites where blockchain exchanges are seen as a more open, community-focused option, whereas traditional exchanges are seen as relics of the old financial system — stuffy and opposed to blockchain technology and crypto.This now seems to be changing, as blockchain exchanges have finally begun to form strategic partnerships with traditional stock exchanges, which allow the blockchain exchanges to utilize their technology in their operations. Is this the future of blockchain exchanges?There are many disadvantages with traditional exchange platforms that blockchain technology and exchanges can help to fix. Firstly, traditional exchanges open and close at set times, which can limit the trading activity of retail investors who may be busy during market hours.Additionally, traditional exchanges can have very expensive and complex fee schemes for trading. This can also put off investors with less money from trading altogether.Many traditional exchanges are still slightly out of reach for the more small-time retail investors who may still want to get involved in trading. This is because many traditional exchanges do not offer fractional purchasing, which is the act of purchasing a fraction of an asset. Rather, the user will be required to buy a certain amount of the asset or a single value of the asset.Despite the inherent benefits of blockchain-operated exchange platforms, there are still a lot of benefits that can be gained through blockchain exchanges utilizing technology created by traditional exchanges.Some traditional exchanges have developed trading systems that can be easily scaled as trading volume increases; with the exponential rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies, ensuring scalability is vital to a cryptocurrency exchange’s operations. Additionally, these trading systems experience low down-time and have high resilience, which ensure a seamless trading experience.Moreover, there has been a widespread belief by many detractors that crypto exchanges are like the Wild West and are unregulated. By forming partnerships with traditional exchanges, crypto exchanges display legitimacy, and traditional exchanges, such as the Nasdaq, therefore, would not agree to work with the specific blockchain exchanges otherwise.Finally, many cryptocurrency exchanges have previously faced issues of unethical trading. Meanwhile, traditional stock exchanges have systems in place that automatically survey any and all trading activity on their platforms. To compare, cryptocurrency exchanges have only recently begun to make use of these technologies to ensure that no abusive trading is taking place and to decrease the cost of surveillance operations, making crypto exchanges safer for traders.The partnerships between traditional stock and asset exchanges and crypto trading platforms can hopefully help to continue a growing trend whereby cryptocurrencies are seen as a valuable, safe and valid asset to be traded.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Oluwatobi Joel is a freelance copywriter, community manager, blockchain expert and serial entrepreneur.

Called “Crypto Earn” the new lending service is “C2B2B” that lends institutions borrowed assets from clients. Last November, TradeStation launched a cryptocurrency brokerage platform via a newly-launched offshoot called TradeStation Crypto. They initially supported Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple (XRP). TradeStation launched its app this month and currently, crypto trading is available in 40 states in the U.S. Monex Group, which is also the owner of prominent Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, bought TradeStation in 2011. This new offering marks yet another traditional finance company entering the crypto lending sector as competition heightens among lenders.In an interview with Cointelegraph Japan in December 2018, John Bartleman, president of TradeStation, clearly stated that their target was institutional investors: “We are planning to target professional investors such as institutional investors unlike Coinbase or Robinhood which mainly target retail investors."" Trade Station invested in Chicago-based crypto exchange ErisX in December 2018. In collaboration with TradeStation, ErisX aims to “bring crypto to the world of traditional investing and trading."""

In addition to being physically bulky and therefore harder to transport, gold has long been extremely difficult to store privately. As Saifedean Ammous noted in his popular book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” government gold confiscation in the early 20th century effectively put an end to individual sovereignty based on physical gold reserves.Schiff did not back his assertions about gold immediately, but is already well known for his support of gold as a superior asset to any cryptocurrency.Bitcoin vs. gold 3-month chart.

The move followed a surge in the underlying asset’s price to a 2020 high of $11,400.On July 29, Bakkt topped the new record with 11,706 contracts traded.“Talk about momentum! We beat yesterday's record with 11,706 Bakkt Bitcoin Futures traded today - that's over $125MM of bitcoin.”Bakkt’s physically-settled contracts are paid out in BTC as opposed to cash-settled contracts that are delivered in USD. The momentum has been driven by Bitcoin prices which have finally broken out of their two and a half month range-bound trading channel.According to data from Skew analytics, Bakkt wasn’t the only institutional exchange to break records this week. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which has far greater volumes than Bakkt, also recorded a surge in Bitcoin futures contracts on Monday.Daily volume topped $1.3 billion while open interest, a measure of the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled, also soared to $724 million. According to CME data, 25,493 futures contracts were traded on Monday, and Tuesday’s preliminary count was already over 20,900 at the time of writing.Yesterday also saw an uptick of Bitcoin options contracts on CME with over 1,100 traded, the highest number for the past thirty days.The two institutional exchanges are small fry compared to the volumes of BTC futures contracts on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Skew also reports that aggregated open interest across all exchanges has also surged to its highest level for a month at $5 billion.According to the chart, Monday saw the highest aggregated daily volume for Bitcoin futures for over a month, and Tuesday will not be far behind it as both institutional and retail interest in BTC derivatives picks up again."
185,"Crypto fund manager Grayscale Investments has managed to increase its assets under management by another $1 billion in less than two weeks.According to an update posted to Grayscale’s Twitter account on July 28, the investment firm currently has $5.1 billion in assets under management (AUM). The funds are mostly held in Grayscale’s trusts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), along with the firm’s digital large cap fund. There are smaller allocations in Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Horizen (ZEN), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar Lumens (XLM), XRP, and Zcash (ZEC) Grayscale assets under management. Source: TwitterThis represents an increase of nearly $1 billion in AUM in just 11 days, according to a July 17 update from Grayscale. The firm more than doubled the AUM in its BCH trust, from $6 million to $12.8 million in that time. Grayscale added $782 million to its BTC trust, $174 million to its ETH trust, $12.7 million to its ETC trust, and $6.7 million to its LTC trust. The firm’s Stellar Lumens Trust was the only one with a drop in AUM, from $600,000 to $500,000.Though the investment firm currently has $4.3 billion in AUM for Bitcoin, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show Grayscale has not purchased any of the cryptocurrency since June 19. On that day, Grayscale bought 19,879 BTC, which at the time appeared to indicate the firm was purchasing Bitcoin faster than miners could produce blocks. However, according to Grayscale’s report from Q3 2019, 80% of inflows that quarter to the firm’s BTC trust came from Bitcoin already in circulation — not from tokens recently mined. The firm refers to these purchases as “in kind” exchanges. Ryan Watkins of crypto analytics firm Messari said in June this meant that Grayscale was more likely buying just 31% of new BTC mined since the May 11 rewards halving. According to Watkins, no new crypto was going into the firm’s Ethereum trust at all.Cointelegraph reported on July 17 that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in the U.S. had verified shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Cash Trust and Litecoin Trust were ready to begin being quoted in OTC markets. The two stocks will soon be available for public trading under the symbols BCHG and LTCN."
186,"Some of the 119,756 Bitcoin that was stolen from crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2016 has started moving again. According to a series of tweets posted by Whale Alert on July 27-28, wallet addresses known to be associated with one of the largest breaches ever of a crypto exchange moved 3503 Bitcoin (BTC) — worth roughly $38.7 million — over 12 transactions. The largest individual movement was of 476.32 BTC, or approximately $5.2 million, while the smallest was 2.612703 BTC, or $28,849.To date, the hackers responsible for the Bitfinex breach have moved only 1-2% of the funds they stole from the exchange in August 2016. The HODLing strategy appears to be paying off as the haul was only worth $72 million at the time. It’s now worth $1.3 billion.The potential impact of such a large number of coins dumped into the crypto market could be problematic. However, the price of Bitcoin was mostly unaffected when 50 BTC of the tokens in old addresses associated with Satoshi Nakamoto moved in May. The lack of movement may suggest that criminals are facing difficulties laundering digital assets as tighter regulations are enforced. Cointelegraph reported in June that 736 BTC from previous transfers from wallets associated with the hack went to the Russian darknet marketplace Hydra — and some actually ended up back at Bitfinex."
187,"Bitcoin (BTC) price finally woke up and surged to a new 2020 high but as the markets surged past $10,000, some traders seem to have opened excessively leveraged long positions. This effect became more noticeable as the funding rate for perpetual contracts reached the second-highest level this year at 12.4% per month.Funding alone shouldn’t be considered a red flag, especially in short-term periods. The problem lies mostly in contango, also known as futures basis, which has been unusually high in the past couple of days. This indicates that professional traders are highly leveraged on the buy-side.Most of those leveraged positions are in profit as contango exceeded a 10% annualized rate before the $10,400 level broke. To confirm whether such optimism is under a controlled situation, one should also evaluate options markets, and determine whether the 25% delta skew is showing signs of stress.Currently BitMEX ranks among the top 3 derivatives exchanges in terms of measured open interest and the exchange also provides clear reporting on its funding rate. Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, require 8-hour adjustments through a funding rate and this will vary depending on the number of active longs versus shorts leverage.Bitcoin XBT perpetual 8-hour funding rate. Source: BitMEXThe funding rate at BitMEX recently reached 0.13%, meaning buyers are paying 12.4% per month to hold long positions. Such level isn’t unprecedented, but as time goes by, it creates an uncomfortable situation for long perpetual contract holders.It’s important to monitor this metric as contango measures the premium of longer-term futures contracts to current spot levels. Professional traders tend to be more active than retail on such instruments as their prices fluctuate more widely, plus there is the hassle of having to handle expiry dates.These contracts usually trade at a slight premium, indicating sellers are requesting more money to withhold settlement longer. Bitcoin futures 3-month annualized basis. Source: SkewThe 3-month futures annualized basis surged past 10% annualized a couple of days ago, and currently it sits at its highest level since early-March. Such strong 15% annualized rates indicate professional traders are paying a sizable premium to spot markets, hence highly leveraged on the buy-side.No set level becomes unbearable for its holders, although a sideways market from here will cause leveraged long positions to become more expensive.Whenever markets enter an ultra-confident scenario, options markets will tend to present unusual data. The 25% delta skew measures how the more expensive market is pricing bullish call options compared to equivalent bearish put options.Bitcoin options 25% delta skew. Source: SkewThe 25% delta skew, considered a fear/greed indicator and it is currently sitting at a negative 12%, meaning protection to the upside is costlier. Once again, this is not a worrisome level, in fact, some will say it is natural after such an impressive $2,000 bull run occurred in less than a week.Even surpassing a 100% annualized rate is not unusual on derivatives markets, mostly because positions are not kept for that long. Nonetheless, no trader would be willing to hold such a leveraged position for more than a couple of weeks on sideways markets.Highly leveraged positions could also indicate that traders are expecting to close it soon enough. Professional investors know that others closely monitor such indicators and use that information on their benefit. Others could have withheld their gains leaving only profits as margin and this could also be contributing to the current excessive leverage phenomenon.Long contract holders seem comfortable enough now that they are in no rush to close their positions. This might change if the $10,400 level is retested, but there are currently no signs of weakness on derivatives markets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

188,"Last week Cointelegraph published a story about investors having difficulty getting their money back from a crypto fund called AMFEIX, which promised high-yield profits for investors who sent them Bitcoin (BTC). Our story described more than 500 pending withdrawals from users trying to get their money back, and AMFEIX’s unsatisfactory communication with those users.The company addressed its users via its official Telegram channel after the story was published, suggesting that the withdrawal delays were due to technical difficulties that had been an issue since May. It also stated that “members who show loyalty to AMFEIX will have priority” in the withdrawal process. The unspoken suggestion is that those who share unflattering coverage of the company won’t see their money returned in a timely fashion.Two hours after that first article was published, AMFEIX distributed a new white paper describing several new policies that were previously undocumented. Most notably it included a clause about defamation, and the company started contacting individuals from its corporate Telegram account to inform them they were in violation.Here’s what people received from the company, whether they shared unflattering coverage or not:You are in violation of policies:28. AMFEIX reserves the right to ban users if suspected of defamation.To rectify the defamation situation an apology from the author (in the form of an article, published on official cointelegraph accounts), and removal of the current article will be necessary. Until it has not been resolved the verification process will have a perpetual pending status on the above addresses.At least three self-identified AMFEIX investors contacted Cointelegraph staff to ask that the article be removed because AMFEIX wanted it done. As of press time, the company has not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment on the article published on Wednesday."
189,"In a webinar hosted by InvestmentNews, Grayscale Investments’ managing director, Michael Sonnenshein, and financial consultant, Tyrone Ross Jr., educated financial advisors about the benefits of crypto investments.A slide from Sonnenshein’s presentation.Grayscale offers ten crypto related investment products with its Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, being by far the largest. Currently, it holds close to 400,000 BTC, though lately, the demand for the product has subsided.Quite a bit of time was spent on some well known aspects of Bitcoin, like its finite supply and instant settlement capabilities. Sonnenshein also informed the audience that physical representations of the asset are not real:“And one thing that's certainly important for you all as advisors and in the investment community is that you oftentimes will see physical adaptations or representations of Bitcoin. But there is, in fact, no tangible Bitcoin.”Sonnenshein drove home that the millennial generation purportedly have quite an appetite for Bitcoin. A few surveys were cited:“There have been some other studies done by Bankrate and Edelman, and ETF Trends, where we've actually seen that millennials are either five times more likely to invest in Bitcoin <...> [or] the percentage of the younger generation are really allocating towards cryptocurrency or expect to be doing so in the near term.”Another important theme was regulation. Sonnenshein acknowledged that in the past, the lack of regulatory clarity was preventing investors from entering the space, but in his opinion, this is no longer a valid excuse:“But we've come to the conclusion that that can really no longer be an excuse for investors.”He noted that the IRS has designated Bitcoin as property and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s guidelines have allowed for the robust futures markets and even the Federal Reserve comparing it to gold.Ross chimed in by explaining to the audience that it does not matter if they believe Bitcoin to be seashells, what matters is that they give sound financial advice to their clients:“I don't care whether you think it's seashells or whatever, that's fine. But at least when the client comes to you, hey, I own some at Coinbase, you can give them a very articulate answer as to why that’s nonsense or to why it's something that you want to continue to articulate in the broader scope of a financial plan or quarterly fair financial plan.”Sonnenshein answered one of the community’s existential questions about the GBTC — why is there such a high premium over the BTC spot price? He explained that accredited investors can purchase newly issued shares of GBTC directly from Grayscale at the net asset value. The premium is dictated by the supply and demand for GBTC on secondary markets. He further noted that Grayscale’s crypto products allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without having to deal with the entry barriers like wallet management."
190,"Mike Alfred, CEO of analytics firm Digital Assets Data, described increased Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasm from the public amid flying prices.“We are seeing more signs of increased institutional interest,” Alfred told Cointelegraph of Bitcoin on July 28 — the day after bitcoin rose more than $1,000 in a 24-hour period.Crypto’s pioneer asset had a standout day on July 27, rising from $9,930 to $11,400 within a single daily price candle, according to TradingView.com data.“Volume was strong on Bakkt and CME yesterday,” Alfred said on July 27, referencing two mainstream traditional financial entities housing BTC trading products.The analytics company CEO also noted other inquiries from the traditional financial world. “Anecdotally, we are receiving a lot more inbound requests from traditional firms looking to get into the space quickly,” he said. “I continue to be bullish,” he added.“DeFi is also a very interesting development but the real economic impact is still somewhat limited,” Alfred explained.The decentralized finance, or DeFi, sector has seen growing interest in 2020 — at least in terms of associated asset prices. A number of DeFi assets have posted over 100% gains in 2020, often in short amounts of time.“The DeFi-related activity is very interesting but ultimately BTC is still the ultimate barometer for the health of the ecosystem,” Alfred told Cointelegraph in a July 27 comment. “The industry has put in a ton of work over the last two years and it finally feels like we've ‘earned’ sustainably higher prices in the underlying assets,” he added.The past two years have yielded a rollercoaster price ride for Bitcoin and the overarching crypto space. Matched with various legal cases, regulatory noise and project developments, the industry has hosted no shortage of action."
191,"A group of hackers associated with the North Korean regime have kept their crypto extortion efforts alive in 2020.A group of North Korean hackers operating under the name “Lazarus” targeted several crypto exchanges last year, according to a report published by Chainalysis.One of the attacks involved the creation of a fake trading bot which was offered to employees of the DragonEx exchange. Findings show that in March 2019, the hackers stole approximately $7 million in various cryptocurrencies from the Singapore-based exchange. Cybersecurity vendor Cyfirma warned in June about a massive crypto phishing campaign that could be launched by the North Korean hacker group.The campaign will allegedly target six nations and over 5 million businesses and individuals. For now, there are no confirmed signs that the team plans to proceed with this massive attack.The hacker group is also known to have stolen a staggering $571 million in cryptocurrencies since early 2017, according to a study conducted by cybercrime company, Group-IB.In March, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, sanctioned two Chinese nationals accused of laundering cryptocurrency that was stolen in a 2018 crypto exchange hack.On July 28, a study performed by the antivirus maker and malware lab, Kaspersky, announced that a new ransomware had been created by Lazarus. This new threat, known as VHD, mostly targets the internal networks of companies in the economic sector.James McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, explained to Cointelegraph how the VHD ransomware operates: “A VHD, or Virtual Hard Disk, is a similar concept to that of a USB drive. Instead of physically inserting the USB drive into the port on a computer, the VHD file can be downloaded onto a system to launch the ransomware attack process. For cybercriminals, they don't need physical access, just electronic access to download the file. This type of attack requires access to the systems. By exploiting external and vulnerable infrastructure or systems, they gain the access needed.""Kaspersky researchers speculated on the possible reasons behind Lazarus’ working solo ops:“We can only speculate about the reason why they are now running solo ops: maybe they find it difficult to interact with the cybercrime underworld, or maybe they felt they could no longer afford to share their profits with third parties.”Lazarus usually breaches a company’s network to encrypt their data. They then proceed to ask victims for a crypto-based ransom, with a preference for Monero (XMR)."
192,"Ciara Sun, head of global markets at Huobi Group, took part in a Cointelegraph China Great Bay Area International Blockchain Week pre-event interview on July 27. She stressed that although security and lack of infrastructure services might be the biggest hurdle for the crypto industry, more clarity in regulation across the globe has led to a great surge in institutional crypto investors.The biggest risk in the digital asset space, according to Ciara Sun, is hacking. She stressed that while hacking doesn't typically lead to massive losses in traditional financial markets, the decentralized nature of digital currencies means there is almost no way to recover lost assets once they are stolen. She added that:“Unlike banks, crypto exchanges simply act as ledgers for transactions. The actual assets are stored in cold wallets, so losses can be permanent if the keys are stolen. Traditional institutions also have very stringent requirements for insurance and escrow to protect users against losses, but the same can't be said about many of the smaller crypto exchanges that operate in this space.”According to Sun, Huobi crypto exchange has made security a priority. She notes that there have been no major security breaches at Huobi for 6+ years. She added an example that:“We've launched an on-chain monitoring tool called Star Atlas to identity and detect illicit activities. Our security team will plan to reveal the security report in a regular routine in the fourth season 2020.”In addition to existing security concerns, Sun pointed out that a lack of services like insurance and custody are major hurdles that prevent many of the larger asset managers and institutional traders from entering the space. She explained:“These larger institutions have higher compliance requirements but regulatory agencies have not provided enough guidance on digital assets in the past. This unclear regulatory landscape has made it riskier for larger institutions. Additionally, the digital asset space is still tiny compared to traditional markets. In the eyes of traditional institutions, crypto is in its infancy as an asset class but exchanges like ours aim to help provide the liquidity and market depth required for crypto to be a viable investment option.”Sun believes while still a nascent industry compared to traditional markets, the digital asset landscape has progressed quite a bit in recent years. “There is now much more regulation and clarity around cryptocurrencies. For example, Singapore, London, Hong Kong, and Japan have all begun regulating crypto with defined policies.”As nations recognize and regulate digital assets as legitimate financial instruments, more institutional adoption starts to show. On Huobi, according to Sun, there is a 3-4X growth in institutional trading on both our spot and derivative markets since early last year. Institutional clients now account for 40% of Huobi’s trading volume, says Sun. She predicts that:“2020 will be an especially exciting year for the institutional market as compliance and regulation matures. We are already seeing big Wall Street stalwarts like Tower Research, Renaissance Technologies, and some of the world's top hedge funds publicly announce their entry into the digital asset market. However, these larger institutions will not trust under-regulated digital asset exchanges, and we are still five years away from market maturity.”The price volatility and high liquidity of digital assets are especially attractive to institutional investors, says Sun. The crypto market is unique in that it can fulfil both demands in liquidity and volatility. She continues with an example that:“Traditional investments like real estate have price volatilities but lack of liquidity. Foreign exchange markets have high liquidity but lack price volatility. Institutional investors see arbitrage opportunities in crypto as an emerging market. The early adopters currently in the market are high-frequency trading institutions.”Additionally, Sun also believes digital assets can offer institutions a way to hedge risk against volatility in traditional investment markets, adding that:“Traditional assets are directly influenced by monetary policies and economic measures like quantitative easing, but digital assets are decoupled from the acts of any one nation or governing body. At a time when governments around the world are printing currency to stabilize their economies, digital assets can be one way to hedge against inflation.”"

Exchange inflows for the stablecoin reached a 2020 high yesterday as Bitcoin (BTC) soared to $10,270, although BTC has since continued on its rally, currently sitting at $11,000.USDT Exchange inflows. Source: GlassnodeWhile research firms have found that there is an inverse correlation between the USDT held on exchanges and the price of Bitcoin, the inflow can also be considered as a bullish sign for Bitcoin as USDT is the fastest and most popular way to acquire Bitcoin.Recently, USDT has broken through several records, having recently overtaken Ripple (XRP) as the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and even surpassing the $10 billion mark this month. Currently USDT accounts for the majority of the collective stablecoin market capitalization which also recently rose above $12 billion.Not only has the market capitalization for USDT been growing consistently (along with most of its USD-based competitors), its volume has recently picked up. Although,USDT volume is still far from it's all-time high in March 2020, volume for the BTC/USDT pair has picked up during the past week and was largely fueled by Bitcoin’s price surge.USDT - 24h volume (BTC).

The growth in value settled through USDT is also largely attributed to inter-exchange settlement and the decentralized finance sector.Bitcoin vs Tether daily transaction value. Source: MessariThe recent spike in exchange inflows along with all the other metrics around USDT may point to a bullish scenario for Bitcoin. While a growing market cap for USDT suggests demand for the stablecoin, increasing exchange inflows show demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Additional demand for USDT could be attributed to the fact that only a few exchanges offer USDT-based derivatives as a means to long and short Bitcoin.However, according to CryptoCompare analyst James Li, the recent USDT exchange inflows observed by Glassnode may not be such a positive factor for Bitcoin price when considered on its own. Li told Cointelegraph:“Looking at historical patterns in the graph alone does not seem to give off a bullish signal in my opinion. Some previous large inflows were followed by price decline, and some didn't move the price. The time when it did eventually lead to price increase was after the big drop in March but this time around, there wasn't a drop preceding this price increase.”"
194,"Numerous unnecessary employees at Twitter allegedly have the ability to reset users’ accounts and modify their security settings. This is a problem that Jack Dorsey, chief executive officer, and the company’s board were warned about all the way back in 2015. According to Bloomberg, Twitter has over 1,500 workers with the abilities to reset accounts and review user breaches. This led to speculation that the hack on July 15 could have been prevented if timelier actions were taken.The report clarified that such credentials gave limited access to most of the workers involved in the social network’s security department. They do note however that it is “a starting point to snoop on or even hack an account.”The “Risk Factors” section of Twitter’s 10-K annual report, filed in 2015 with the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC, confirms that Dorsey & Co. had long been warned of this potential attack vector:“Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users or advertisers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or advertisers’ data or accounts, or may otherwise obtain access to such data or accounts.” Bloomberg mentions that at one point in 2017 and 2018, Twitter contractors created a “game” which consisted of flooding the help-desk with bogus inquiries, allowing them to access celebrities’ accounts. They used this access to trace personal data and approximate locations based on the owner’s IP addresses. Twitter’s 2020 10-K annual report, filed with the SEC, referred to “unauthorized parties” access:“Unauthorized parties may also gain access to Twitter handles and passwords without attacking Twitter directly and, instead, access people’s accounts by using credential information from other recent breaches, using malware on victim machines that are stealing passwords for all sites, or a combination of both.”The recent Twitter attack posted a fake Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway via the accounts of some of the most powerful verified accounts in the world. These included Joe Biden, Elon Musk, George Wallace, Bill Gates, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Wiz Khalifa, Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Barack Obama, and Jeff Bezos, among others."
195,"Despite Russia recently passing its first major legislation devoted to cryptocurrencies, the country’s central bank continues to treat the industry as a criminal area.Sergei Shvetsov, the first deputy governor at the Bank of Russia, has voiced the bank’s negative stance towards crypto investment. He compared cryptocurrency with financial pyramid schemes and roulette games. The official provided his remarks on the crypto industry during a July 28 live YouTube stream regarding Russia’s new bill on categories of retail investors.During the live session, Shvetsov emphasized that the Bank of Russia does not recognize crypto purchases as an investment. He said:“The Bank of Russia, as a regulator, adheres to the position that crypto purchases are not an investment. It is more like a financial pyramid or roulette games, and does not apply to the financial market. Either government or financial intermediaries should not encourage citizens to acquire cryptocurrencies.”Comparing cryptocurrencies with “money surrogates,” Shvetsov argued that no central bank around the world supports such money substitutes. “They are prohibited by the Russian Constitution and subject to criminal liability,” Shvetsov continued.The executive continued that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are often used for illicit activities like money laundering, and thus should not be supported by the bank. The official said:""Cryptocurrencies are also used to circumvent Anti-Money Laundering regulations. Therefore, we absolutely do not support citizens' investment in this criminal sector.""The Bank of Russia’s latest comments come shortly after Russian lawmakers passed a major crypto bill, “On Digital Assets,” or DFA, on July 22. However, the DFA bill does not envision the actual regulation of the industry. Regulatory framework is planned to be part of another upcoming bill, titled “On Digital Currency.”Prohibiting the use of crypto as a payment method, the DFA bill does not provide much information about cryptocurrency investments. In the meantime, the Bank of Russia is a key regulator mentioned in the bill document, authorizing the bank to define what types of investors are eligible for investing in this or that crypto product.Similarly to other central banks over the world, Russia’s central bank has been desperately confronting legalization of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.In March 2020, the bank argued that the DFA bill will ban the issuance and circulation of crypto in Russia. The bill ultimately turned out to be less hostile to the industry. In February 2020, the bank issued a set of rules for suspicious transactions, categorizing any crypto-related transaction as a potential money laundering risk.Russia’s central bank is not alone in its negative stance towards crypto. A number of banks around the world, including India’s RBI have been trying to ban cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in order to confront the new decentralized assets. However, even India’s central bank eventually reversed its decision when the Supreme Court lifted RBI’s ban in March 2020. Other global authorities that have explicitly banned crypto are the central banks of Myanmar and Zimbabwe."
196,"Another key metric points to the recovery of the Bitcoin (BTC) market — the current price has recently doubled the asset’s “realized” price.Bitcoin price versus realized price.

The realized market capitalization is computed by multiplying each Unspent Transaction Output or UTXO by the prevailing price when it was last moved.

Traditionally, the realized cap and price have ranged below the actuals; however, around Black Thursday (March 19), it flipped.Bitcoin net unrealized profit. Source: Glassnode.In the months that followed, the relationship has returned to the normal range. As of July 27, the actual price was almost double that of the realized price.

A recent report by Bloomberg suggested that the former is more likely as it is expecting BItcoin to rise above $12,000."
197,"The price of Bitcoin officially surpassed $10,400 on July 27, breaking out of a multiyear range as a result. Traders are now mixed on where Bitcoin’s (BTC) price will go next, as many indicators and data points show conflicting trends.The general sentiment around Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry has been positive since April. The United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency granted banks permission to operate crypto custody services, institutional investors have continuously invested in Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies through Grayscale, and most recently, the Tether (USDT) stablecoin saw its largest inflow in eight months.A confluence of strong fundamental factors related to regulation and infrastructure has seemingly improved the perception of Bitcoin by the mainstream. That has coincided with an increase in liquidity triggered by high Tether inflow and the recovery of futures market open interest. A rising inflow of Tether is an important metric due to it being the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. The numbers suggest that the demand for the stablecoin is increasing, indicating a growing appetite for crypto assets.Some macro factors could have fueled the demand for Bitcoin in recent months. Since April, the U.S. dollar has been in decline relative to other major reserve currencies. Investors such as billionaire Ray Dalio have pointed at the ongoing dispute between the U.S. and China as the biggest factor. As the U.S. dollar has dropped, the price of gold has gone up. Historically, a weak dollar has caused the stock market to underperform, which would, in theory, boost gold. Given the recent price correlation between gold and Bitcoin, there is a chance that a weakening dollar will indirectly benefit BTC.The correlation between Bitcoin and gold in recent months. Source: Skew.comBased on market structure, traders expect the price of Bitcoin to range in the near term. BTC has broken out of a critical resistance level at $10,500. After such a powerful upward price movement, some stability would cool down the market. Michaël van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and a Cointelegraph contributor, said that Bitcoin could soon see a new range. Considering that $12,000 has acted as strong resistance in the past, van de Poppe suggested a $9,700–$12,000 range could materialize.A new Bitcoin range could form. Source: Michaël van de PoppeAs Bitcoin saw an explosive upward price movement, trading volumes surged in tandem. According to Skew, July 27 was the second-highest volume day in the history of Bitcoin. As BTC comes off a record-setting rally, below is an overview of bullish and bearish scenarios that could impact price in the near term.Some traders and investors foresee a continuation of the ongoing Bitcoin rally. According to the cryptocurrency trader known as Ethereum Jack, BTC recently saw a clean breakout. It marked the fifth upsurge to a resistance level that has held up since September 2019. The trader emphasized that the price trend of Bitcoin could become overextended if the rally resumes, but he noted that it has all the characteristics of a prolonged uptrend:“$BTC giving the cleanest breakout-retest setup I have seen in a very long time whilst each corrective wave since 4K has been vertical re-accumulation. This has all characteristics for a strongly extended fifth — aside from BTC generally loving extended fifths.”Cryptocurrency trader Koroush AK said that Bitcoin currently has three bullish arguments. First, the 0.618 Fibonacci level measured in between $9,300 and $11,421 has to hold. The 0.618 level marks an important level in the Fibonacci retracement system, and it typically leads to a trend reversal when breached. Second, the $10,400 level acts as robust horizontal support. Third, as long as the $10,170 level is kept, the argument for a higher low is intact.In simple terms, Koroush AK believes that if the price of Bitcoin stays above $10,170, $10,400 and $10,622, the price trend will remain bullish. The $10,170 level, or a higher low, is particularly critical in technical analysis, as it suggests a strong uptrend. A higher-low pattern forms when the most recent low point of an asset is higher than the previous low points.A breakdown of key levels for Bitcoin in the short-term. Source: Koroush AKSimilarly, the Bitcoin trader known as Satoshi Flipper suggested that there is little resistance between $10,886 and $11,400. As BTC comes fresh off of a breakout above $11,000 for the first time since August 2019, traders seemingly anticipate volatility in the newfound range.Apart from fundamentals, technology researcher Kevin Rook emphasized that the “HODLing” level of Bitcoin is at a record high. That metric indicates that many long-term holders of BTC are reluctant to sell the top cryptocurrency. It could show that BTC is currently in an accumulation phase, with Rook stating: “62% of Bitcoin supply (11,400,000 BTC) has not moved in at least a year. The speculators are gone, HODLing is at an all-time high.” The first major breakout in nearly 11 months, an increase in long-term BTC holders and a favorable market structure strengthen the bullish outlook on Bitcoin.In the near term, however, some traders expect a cool-off in the cryptocurrency market. Following a large Bitcoin price upsurge, various metrics suggest that the rally is overextended. The most prominent metric of all is likely the funding rate.Bitcoin futures contracts without expiration dates are called perpetual swaps. They are the most utilized futures contracts in the cryptocurrency market, as they are less complex to trade. But the lack of expiration dates is balanced with a mechanism called funding, which forces long or short contract holders to pay their counterpart a fee once every eight hours, depending on market sentiment.When the funding rate of Bitcoin perpetual swaps turns positive, it means the majority of the market is long on BTC’s price. For instance, BitMEX has shown a funding rate of around 0.077% for Bitcoin perpetual swaps in the last two days. That shows that the overwhelming majority of the market is longing BTC, leaving the cryptocurrency vulnerable to a potential long squeeze.Bitcoin perpetual swap funding rates across major exchanges. Source: SkewSome traders state that the funding rates of perpetual swaps are simply too high to be sustained. Referring to the funding rates, the cryptocurrency trader known as Byzantine General said, “This needs to cool off for a bit.”In terms of market structure, Bitcoin technical analyst Crypto Capo said BTC could confirm its uptrend if it stays above $10,500 and establishes it as a clear level of support. But if BTC rejects in the short term and drops below the level, he said there is a chance of a UTAD forming. A UTAD, meaning “upthrust after distribution,” is a pattern that is a part of the Wyckoff Method. It forms when an asset demonstrates a fakeout and proceeds to pull back. Several traders believe that there is still a small chance that the entire uptrend of BTC is a fake rally. StockCharts describes a UTAD as:“A UT or UTAD allows large interests to mislead the public about the future trend direction and, subsequently, sell additional shares at elevated prices to such break-out traders and investors before the markdown begins.”Another well-known cryptocurrency trader known as CryptoWhale said that the sentiment around the Bitcoin market is too fearful. The trader noted that the BTC rally follows “months of red” and that the cryptocurrency will probably see a correction.Overall, the market is seemingly divided between traders who believe the rally is overextended and those who see a continuation. There are viable reasons to support both arguments, as funding rates signal an overheated market and BTC’s stability above $10,500 indicates strong momentum."

The situation is much different today. We are working closely with law enforcement agencies on the recent Twitter hacking bitcoin scam, for example,” he concluded."
200,"Bitcoin (BTC) will not stop rising until it hits $28,000, Max Keiser believes as the largest cryptocurrency gains over 20% in a week.In a series of tweets on July 27, the famously outspoken host of the Keiser Report forecast that BTC/USD was headed for six figures after a correction period near $30,000.Keiser made the prediction as Bitcoin passed $11,200 during a day of surprises. As Cointelegraph reported, $10,000 managed to hold for longer than a matter of hours, and data indicated that this latest trip to five figures was sturdier than others in 2020.“$28,000 is in play before we see a pullback - and then we’re heading to 6-figures,” Keiser summarized.Well known for his optimism and heavy preference for BTC over other cryptocurrencies, Keiser further took a swipe at gold bug Peter Schiff. Schiff, who has been celebrating gold hitting all-time highs against the U.S. dollar, had previously dismissed Bitcoin’s rise.“It’s put up or shut up for Bitcoin — it’s got to hold $10,000 now,” he said during a debate with Morgan Creek Digital co-founder, Anthony Pompliano, on his YouTube channel on Sunday.Keiser had little time for this and Schiff’s other arguments, claiming that in fact, the Bitcoin skeptic was secretly regretting his choice of gold.“Somewhere, @PeterSchiff is puking his brains out right now,” the same tweet reads.Bitcoin versus gold 3-month chart.

For Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb, however, even flipping slightly lower levels as support would be a turning point for Bitcoin, with $10,500 formerly marking severe resistance.“Breakout! $10,500 the level that needs to become support... then... then things get real interesting,” he wrote on his Telegram trading channel."
201,"Swiss SIX Exchange, one of the world’s largest stock exchanges, is listing a new cryptocurrency exchange-traded product, or ETP.Dubbed the “Bitcoin Capital Active ETP,” the new trading product represents an actively managed crypto ETP, trading Bitcoin (BTC) against 14 top altcoins like Ether (ETH) and exiting to fiat without active involvement from investors.Claimed to be the world’s first actively managed crypto ETP, the new product is now listed on SIX Exchange under index BTCA.The BTCA is registered by Swiss-based crypto investment management firm FiCAS and issued by Bitcoin Capital AG. The new ETP product is issued at 100 Swiss francs, the firm said.Mattia Rattaggi, chairman of the FiCAS Board, explained that the issue price of the BTCA was driven by the desire to accommodate and facilitate market liquidity, retail concerns and portfolio management rebalancing requirements. Rattaggi noted that investors now have a new option of investing money into a crypto ETP that discharges their direct involvement, comparing the BTCA to traditional discretionary portfolio management. Rattaggi added that the new product should be a good fit for the nascent crypto market:“Time will tell how this innovation will impact the industry. Arguably, an actively managed, discretionary ETP may be better suited for the still nascent cryptocurrency markets, because it focuses on active risk management more than in a systematically-driven passive ETP.”The list of cryptocurrencies authorized for trading is defined and driven by SIX Exchange, the Rattaggi said, “We have chosen coins that have their own blockchain, high market capitalization and a large liquidity pool.” He noted that the ETP does not include privacy coins.In traditional finance markets, an ETP is a type of security that is priced derivatively and trades based on investment tools such as a commodity, a currency, a share price, or an interest rate. Opposed to crypto exchange-traded funds, or crypto ETFs, crypto ETPs are always 100% backed by the assets they are tracking.Swiss SIX Exchange has listed multiple crypto ETPs since listing the world’s first crypto ETP in late 2018. At the time, the stock exchange listed Amun’s Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracked five major cryptos like Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). Since January 2020, SIX Exchange has also been actively listing numerous ETPs backed by crypto asset manager 21Shares."
202,"Nigel Green, the CEO and founder of financial consultancy firm deVere Group, says Bitcoin’s recent bullish activity shows it has the power to replace proven safe haven assets like gold.In a statement on the deVere Group’s website posted July 27, Green said Bitcoin (BTC) is currently living up to its namesake as “digital gold” while it and other cryptocurrencies are more likely to be seen as safe haven assets. “Up to now, gold has been known as the ultimate safe-haven asset, but Bitcoin — which shares its key characteristics of being a store of value and scarcity — could potentially knock gold from its long-held position in the future as the world becomes ever-more tech-driven.”The CEO cited increasing political tension between the United States and China as one reason investors might choose “decentralized, non-sovereign, secure digital currencies” as a way to protect them from turbulence in traditional markets.Green’s comments were made following BTC’s rise to $10,000 on July 26, while the token is priced at more than $11,000 at the time of writing. Gold has also reached a new record intraday high of $1,975 per ounce as of today amid news the U.S. government would be passing another $1 trillion stimulus bill in response to the economic impact of COVID-19. Prominent gold bug Peter Schiff has predicted the price of the commodity will continue to “soar” beyond $2,000 as the Fed keeps printing dollars. The U.S. dollar is currently at a two-year low, but Schiff says the decline of America’s currency is “just getting started.”“It's about to plunge to new depths, taking the American standard of living down with it,” said Schiff.

207,"Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied within $50 of the $11,000 mark after managing a strong breakout above the $10,500 level. For the past 6 months analysts have kept a laser sharp focus on the key level and many forecast that Bitcoin price would soar once the multi-year resistance was obliterated.

Source: Coin360Cointelegraph contributor Keith Wareing suggested that Bitcoin price could rapidly move higher as traders’ sentiment will have grown increasingly bullish after the long-term resistance level becomes a new support. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewAs the 1-hour chart shows, Bitcoin’s recent surge above the long-term descending trendline from the 2017 all-time high, and today’s move above $10,500 were fueled by high volume spikes. At the time of writing, the moving average convergence divergence and the relative strength index are both in overbought territory, showing bulls are currently in full control. Typically and overbought RSI and MACD serve as sell signals but Bitcoin’s price history over the years demonstrates that both oscillators can remain deeply oversold as the price surges to new highs. As mentioned in yesterday’s Cointelegraph market update, Bitcoin has rallied nearly 20% since July 21 and this strong move has occurred without a significant retest of the former S/R flips. Traders should keep a close eye on trading volume on the smaller time frames as a steep drop off in buy volume could possibly lead to a retest of the $9,500 level.  Bitcoin daily price chart.

208,"Bloomberg’s mid-year report indicates that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could soon rise above $12,000.The report contends that both on-chain and off-chain indicators for Bitcoin point to the asset’s appreciation. One of the key metrics for Bloomberg is the number of active addresses. Bloomberg elaborated:“The 2019 Bitcoin end-of-day high was $12,734, based on Bloomberg pricing. Unless advancing addresses abruptly reverse, history suggests Bitcoin may gravitate toward that level.”Bloomberg suggests that the continuous growth of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust or GBTC and the shrinkage of the premium versus the Bitcoin spot market should also be interpreted as bullish for the market:“On a 30-day-average basis, the Trust's 20% premium to its underlying net asset value compares with the historical mean of 39%.”Though we should note that lately, the growth of GBTC has stagnated.The report states that the recent decision by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to allow the U.S. banks to provide custody for digital assets should clear the last hurdle for institutional investors. Nonetheless, it notes that it is essential for Bitcoin to breach the $10,000 plateau (likely the report was compiled last week) to sustain this momentum.Although Bloomberg remains optimistic about Bitcoin, its level of optimism is seemingly diminishing. In late June the publication was suggesting that Bitcoin was eyeing the $13,000 resistance; and in early June, it was prognosing it to soar above $20,000."
209,"The price of Bitcoin hit $10,463 on BitMEX, slightly below the previous peak in June. But two indicators are signaling a BTC cool-off: TD9 and exchange inflows.The price of Bitcoin tests a crucial resistance level. Source: Raoul PalThe TD9 is a trend-reversal indicator that is a part of the TD sequential system. It typically indicates if a rally or a correction is over-extended.Similarly, exchange inflows, especially among whales, often suggest that the ongoing rally could be overcrowded.A TD9 sell signal triggers essentially when the price of Bitcoin rises for nine consecutive days without a major pullback. If nine candles all stay above the close of the four candles prior, then a TD9 lights up.Since July 19, the price of Bitcoin has increased from $9,219 to $10,463. The four candles prior to the most recent nine daily candles closed at $9,150, making a TD9.The TD9 in itself could be unreliable. It does not take into account the fundamentals or technicals of an asset. But when BTC rallies for nine straight days, and it coincides with other factors, it might hint at a pullback.Apart from the TD9, analysts are exploring exchange inflows of BTC. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young-Ju, exchange inflows spiked upon Bitcoin’s latest rally. He suggested that some whales could be getting cautious. He said:“BTC price went up too fast. Seems like other whales think so too.”Bitcoin exchange inflows spike as BTC surges. Source: CryptoQuantThe funding rates of perpetual futures contracts across major exchanges, like BitMEX and Binance Futures, are also surging. Perpetual futures contracts do not have any expiration dates, unlike conventional futures contracts. As such, exchanges use a mechanism called funding to incentivize users that bet against the majority of the market.For example, if the Bitcoin futures market has more than 60% of longs, the funding rate would increase and incentivize short holders.Currently, the funding rates on BitMEX and Binance Futures are 0.072% and 0.054%, respectively. Usually, the funding rate of BTC perpetual contracts hovers at around 0.01%. It indicates that the majority of the market are longing, which might leave BTC vulnerable to a long squeeze.Meanwhile, some other traders and technical analysts believe that Bitcoin may continue to rally without major pullbacks.Zoran Kole, a cryptocurrency trader, said he expects Bitcoin to stabilize at the $10,000 to $10,100 support range, before moving upwards. Based on market structure, the trader explained that BTC could surge to as high as $11,500. He wrote:“Looking to long range high retest/DBS Zone. Invalidation below weekly open/9900 sweep. Targeting 11.5-11.6 weekly kumo top.”Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision Group, said that the real rally of Bitcoin starts when BTC crosses $10,500. Whether it corrects before hitting the crucial resistance level is an uncertainty, Pal said. But he noted that he expects the momentum to continue. He said:“The real game in bitcoin begins over $10,500. Maybe it corrects first, maybe not but I'm hodling.”Simon Peters, a cryptoasset analyst at global investment platform eToro, shared his comments, saying:“Bitcoin’s network metrics are also looking pretty healthy. Glassnode’s Reserve Risk metric… is currently signaling an attractive risk-to-reward level, indicating that confidence is high and the price is low.”While several fundamental indicators point toward a minor short-term pullback, some traders believe the momentum of BTC is too strong for a deep correction."
210,"With low barriers for entering, competition for digital asset exchanges is intense, with an estimated more than 10,000 exchanges now operating worldwide. This competition reduces margins for all of them and also lowers deposit and withdrawal thresholds. Add in a confusing patchwork of global regulations, and profitability challenges for digital asset exchanges loom large.Digital asset exchanges must overcome these obstacles to attract institutional traders who will generate the sector’s next growth wave. These high-powered traders seek crypto exchanges that can give them the liquidity they need, as well as an edge in speed with instant deposit, withdrawal and transfer. Equally important, the ability to offer instant settlements would enable them to make more trades with less capital. The path forward lies in a new paradigm that brings the expanding universe of players closer together.The market fragmentation brought on by so many exchanges operating globally has had a wide-ranging impact on digital asset trading. Due to disparate regional and local regulations, crypto exchanges must primarily pair with local fiat currencies for their trading, causing them to act as isolated trading islands with limited liquidity. No trading platform represents more than a 5% share of spot trading volume. This limited liquidity leads to different prices across geographies and exchanges.Even so, this market fragmentation creates market opportunities for traders. Savvy traders will execute cross-exchange arbitrage trades, acquire organic liquidity from other regions, and/or execute on strategies that depend on more reliable signals from untapped global liquidity. However, there are strong barriers to execution. For institutional traders to fully realize these opportunities, they need capabilities for instantaneous cross-exchange transfer, instant global settlement and instant reallocation of funds across exchanges.Institutional traders will lead the next wave of digital asset trading adoption. A recent report from Fidelity Digital Assets found that nearly 80% of approximately 800 institutional investors surveyed expressed interest in the space. The exchanges that can adapt quickly to their needs will be in the best position to attract and retain these valuable traders — it’s an evolution that could generate up to a 200% trading volume increase.Ideally, there would be a single unified solution that helps crypto exchanges significantly improve their performance in areas important to institutional traders. These traders must currently employ costly workarounds, such as holding accounts with multiple exchanges and spreading trades out among them, an inefficient arrangement that also makes for poor capital utilization. What they need is the ability to achieve faster deposits, withdrawals and cross-exchange transfers to take valuable capital off the sidelines and to execute more profitable trade opportunities.Unsurprisingly, for the cryptocurrency exchanges, the answer lies in fresh blockchain technology applications. An instant global settlement solution would resolve slow withdrawals, deposits and transfers. The new type of network provides truly instant global clearing and settlement of most asset classes for digital asset trading platforms, banks and traditional trading institutions. The participants in this new ecosystem will enjoy real-time clearing and settlement for digital assets and payments that are secure, reliable and convenient.Exchanges participating in a global instant settlement network gain many advantages in attracting institutional investors and traders to their platforms. Overall, a network provides institutions access to a more unified, global market. Participation gives exchanges the ability to provide instant deposits and withdrawals, enabling institutional clients to rapidly transfer capital between exchanges while increasing capital utilization. Settlement speed also increases, which enables the execution of cross-exchange strategies. For example, traders can buy Bitcoin (BTC) on one exchange valued at $9,000 and then immediately sell it on another valued at $9,150, avoiding potential price swings that would introduce risk into such trades while awaiting settlement, which can take from 20 to more than 60 minutes. Other advantages of this approach include a reduction in settlement costs, which helps to boost profit margins.Better pricing and liquidity are keys to trading, but they are not the only considerations for institutional traders. Ease of use, cost and settlement time are equally important factors in choosing a trading venue. The flow of funds and velocity of funds are also important to traders when selecting where they will execute their trades — seamless movement and redemption become easier when all of these processes take place within such a network.An even bigger win-win takes shape as the global instant settlement network grows. Network effects increase value and unify the previously fragmented landscape of exchanges, each of which sees greater revenue via the rise in institutional volume. With that kind of impact, it’s clear why the global instant settlement network model isn’t just a differentiator for exchanges. It’s a necessary step to enable institutional traders to execute global trading strategies. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

212,"Bitcoin (BTC) begins a new week above $10,000 and teasing investors with more gains — will it last or is a correction already guaranteed?Cointelegraph takes a look at the coming week and what it might have in store for the Bitcoin price — five factors that could take BTC/USD to the moon or back down to four figures.While stocks futures were inching higher on Monday, the focus for macro was more on geopolitical tensions. The United States and China continued to ratchet up the hostile mood, while coronavirus woes likewise stayed in the headlines.Both issues have had a conspicuous impact on demand for safe havens, and notably gold. As Cointelegraph reported, last week witnessed major appreciation in both gold and silver, while the weekend saw bullion hit record intraday highs.In line with previous sentiment gauges, plenty of faith lies in Bitcoin following the precious metal’s lead.Speaking to Bloomberg, one analyst predicted that gold’s run was far from over.“Strong gains are inevitable as we enter a period much like the post-GFC environment, where gold prices soared to record levels as a result of copious amounts of Fed money being pumped into the financial system,” Gavin Wendt, senior resource analyst at Australia’s MineLife Pty said.At the same time, Citigroup placed the odds of XAU/USD topping $2,000 by the end of 2020 at 30%.“The U.S. dollar just hit an all-time record low. You now need over $1,920 to buy a single ounce of #gold,” gold bug Peter Schiff summarized. “But this record won't last long as the dollar's decline is only just getting started. It's about to plunge to new depths taking the American standard of living down with it.”Bitcoin versus gold 3-month chart. Source: SkewAgainst a backdrop of a flight to havens, Bitcoin’s rise to $10,300 is hardly surprising. Weeks of price compression were long anticipated to resolve in a break up or down — analysts were just split over which direction the market would go. The speed of the weekend’s breakout nonetheless was troubling for some. Specifically, trader behavior suggests that the mood is increasingly turning to short-term profit-taking.“BTC price went up too fast. Seems like other whales think so too,” Ki Young Ju, founder of on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, summarized.Ki uploaded a chart showing exchange inflows for the past three days, which revealed a noticeable spike in the number of coins moving to exchange wallets.At the start of the surge, a lack of selling from long-term hodlers gave the impression that this time, $10,000 would not disappear in a sell-off as with the two previous spikes.CryptoQuant’s data now suggests that the temptation for many is too high. Bitcoin exchange inflows 3-day chart. Source: CryptoQuantA familiar force returning to Bitcoin this week concerns derivatives markets — a gap in CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market.Underscoring the contrast to compression, the difference between Friday’s trading session end and Monday’s start is a matter of several hundred dollars — with approximately $9,650 and $9,900 as the corridor.As Cointelegraph frequently reports, BTC/USD has a habit of “filling” gaps left in futures, often within a matter of days or even hours after they appear.As such, attention was focusing on a potential dip to $9,600 from press-time levels of $10,250 to seal the gap. Orders were piling up below the bottom of the corridor on Monday, around the so-called point of control (POC) at $9,575,  leading Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe to draw different conclusions about Bitcoin and the rest of the market.“To be honest, I believe Ethereum is starting in a new cycle and Bitcoin is still stuck in its range,” he said in private comments.“The only suspicion I have is that we’re going to have a drop to $9,400 and continue the range for a month.”Ether went beyond expectations with its own gains over the weekend, firmly beating resistance at $285 and continuing to $330.CME Bitcoin futures 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewReturning to macro, U.S. stimulus measures were due to be unveiled on Monday, pumping further dollars into the economy. At the same time, markets were listening out for fresh directives from the Federal Reserve, which analysts tip to keep interest rates at 0.25%.Any effect that this decision has on stocks could well contribute to the Bitcoin trajectory, despite the weekend forming an exception to the correlation that BTC price has shown to stocks.Bitcoin versus S&P 500 3-month chart. Source: Skew“The reason COVID19 is fatal to the U.S. economy is that we borrowed so much money to artificially boost GDP and the stock market in the past,” Schiff continued, adding:“So, we're too broke to borrow more to fight Covid now and all we can do is print. The dollar will crash taking the economy down with it.”Schiff, as ever, was less than optimistic about Bitcoin’s prospects, privileging gold as the main safe haven as the dollar falls.Unlike spot traders, Bitcoin miners seemed calm throughout the recent volatility. According to CryptoQuant, mining pool outflows did not spike as a result of price gains.Previous events caused much more turbulence, notably May’s block subsidy halving, which cut miner rewards by 50% overnight.Bitcoin mining pool outflows 1-year chart.

213,"Within the last hour, Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $10,000 to set a new monthly high at $10,315. The move came after a rather uneventful weekly close which saw the top-ranked digital asset on CoinMarketCap close above an important multi-year descending trendline. A few hours after the close, Bitcoin price found renewed strength and surged above the $10,100 resistance zone.Crypto market weekly price chart. Source: Coin360Analysts now expect traders to target $10,500, and above this level price estimates ranging from $11,000, $14,000 and even $16,000 have been thrown about. While this is exciting for bulls, it’s important to note that Bitcoin price has rallied 12.76% since rising from $9,142 on July 21 and the price has yet to retest underlying support around $9,450. There is also a CME gap at $9,615 which has yet to be filled. Given the importance traders attribute to CME gaps, any pullback below $9,800 heightens the likelihood that the gap will be filled. The last two moves above $10,000 occurred on high volume surges, meaning traders should keep an eye on buy and sell volume on the 1 and 4-hour timeframe to determine if the current move can keep upward momentum. Bitcoin daily price chart. Source: Coin360In the event of a pullback, traders will likely look for a retest of the $10,100 area and a strong pullback could see the price drop to $9,800-$9,900 where the price may consolidate. Ether (ETH) price also surged higher as Bitcoin price surged to $10,315. At the time of publishing, Ether trades at $329 after rallying 5%. As mentioned in an earlier analysis, above $317 traders will have set their sights on the June 26 high at $367, but given that the altcoin has rallied 40% since July 21 there is also a possibility that traders booking profits will lead Ether price to correct.

214,"U.S. residents who invested their first stimulus checks in Bitcoin have seen a 45.5% return, from $1,200 in April to roughly $1,746 at the time of writing, when the cryptocurrency is surging past $10,200.In a July 26 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow confirmed Americans will be receiving another $1,200 check as part of a roughly $1 trillion stimulus package first announced on July 23. However, according to Newsweek, many Americans have reported not receiving the first checks, which the U.S. Treasury started issuing in late March. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the second payments will arrive in August, but that could potentially mean November for some if the process is the same.The stimulus checks are intended to ease the economic hardship suffered by many U.S. residents who lost their jobs or are seeing much lower income amid the coronavirus pandemic. However, Cointelegraph reported in April that many Americans may have chosen to invest their first payment not in delaying eviction or supplementing their income — when necessary — but cryptocurrency. Brian Armstrong of Coinbase showed that the number of deposits and buys on the exchange worth $1,200 increased fourfold that month.Based on online responses to the news that another check would be forthcoming, coupled with the recent surge of Bitcoin (BTC) to more than $10,200, some crypto traders may be thinking another $1,200 investment isn’t the worst idea. “Straight to the BTC, straight to the cold storage wallet,” said Reddit user Limited-Visibility.“What I do get will go straight to Bitcoin, just like last time,” said rapierce0238.The announcement that $1,200 checks for every U.S. resident would once again be a part of the stimulus package came just hours before Bitcoin experienced another surge, rising 3.1% from $9,941 to $10,249 in the last four hours. When U.S. officials first announced the $1 trillion stimulus package on July 23, the price of BTC rose past $9,500, breaking a particularly long stretch of low volatility between $9,000-$9,500."
215,"Bitcoin (BTC) may have only held $10,000 for a matter of hours, but according to glassnode, an on-chain monitoring resource, this moon is not like others in 2020.On July 26 Glassnode uploaded surprising data about Bitcoin’s latest trip to five figures and suggested that the current journey above $10,000 will be much different than the last few.As Cointelegraph reported, BTC/USD suddenly crushed the last remaining resistance below $10,000 on Sunday, rising to hit highs of $10,200.The excitement was short-lived, with the pair then dropping to circle the $9,900 level at press time.BTC/USD 7-day chart.

Source: Glassnode/ TwitterCautious optimism that Bitcoin is destined for higher levels still has become a theme in itself among traders in recent months.When PayPal sparked rumors of crypto acceptance in June, for example, talk immediately turned to Bitcoin’s potential to seal not only $10,000, but as much as $12,000 in the short term. Network fundamentals remain encouraging, while Sunday’s spurt similarly marks a firm contrast to the pattern of compression that Bitcoin exhibited in prior weeks. A cycle of higher lows and lower highs had placed BTC/USD in a narrowing corridor that analysts agreed must soon break.Altcoins were similarly bullish on the day, with Ether (ETH) breaking firm resistance at $280 in a move which surprised even more than Bitcoin.

One of the videos also featured an image of SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk supposedly giving away Bitcoin. The scammers were promising to double the Bitcoin sent to them.  By press time, Ajey Nagar announced that his Youtube channel is back to normal. Source: Ajey Nagar Twitter Post  This is not the first time Bitcoin giveaway scams made their way on Youtube. As Cointelegraph previously reported, fake Bitcoin giveaways from channels claiming to belong to Elon Musk scammed users out of $150,000. Scammers recently also attempted to use the “double your money” cons to target VeChain VET tokens holders. YouTube’s legal team has argued the platform is immune from liability for cryptocurrency scams perpetrated as part of its video content or descriptions."
217,"The total crypto market capitalization has reached $300 billion for the first time since mid-February, which is a huge positive as it suggests increased investor interest in cryptocurrencies. The interest has largely been in smaller altcoins with Bitcoin (BTC) taking a back seat until early this morning. Even Ether (ETH) recently joined the altseason party and once it broke out of its resistance the price skyrocketed higher. This could have resulted in a missed opportunity for several traders who did not buy on the breakout. Now, traders are likely to expect a similar move from the top-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap as it has also been range-bound for a long time.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Therefore, several bulls are likely to start buying Bitcoin without waiting for it to breakout and short positions are likely to cover, which could provide the needed push to carry the price above the stiff overhead resistance. As the momentum picks up, there could be a buying stampede as traders fear missing out on the rally. The upcoming week is critical as it will provide insight into whether the altcoins will continue to lead the market or if Bitcoin will join in and shift traders’ focus away from altcoins. Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the $10,100 level today for the first time since early-June, which is likely to boost sentiment. However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight as they will aggressively defend the $10,000–$10,400 resistance zone.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewCurrently, the price has dipped back below the $10,000 levels but the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that minor dips are being purchased.This change in sentiment increases the possibility of a break above the $10,400 resistance. If the price sustains above $10,400, it could result in short covering and aggressive buying by the bulls.Such a move could quickly carry the price to $11,870.50, which is the pattern target of the breakout from the bullish ascending triangle pattern.A breakout and close (UTC time) above $10,400 will also complete a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target objective of $16,997. However, this target is likely to be achieved in the medium-term as the bears will aggressively defend the $14,000 levels.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the trendline of the ascending triangle.

The price is currently consolidating between the $9,800–$10,000 level, which is a positive sign.If the bulls can again push the price above $10,000 and sustain the higher levels for four hours, a move to $10,400 levels is likely. A break above this level will be a huge positive and could result in a sharp move higher.This bullish view will be invalidated in the short-term if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-exponential moving average. Such a move will indicate that the momentum has weakened and could lead to a minor consolidation.After consolidating for about two months, Ether (ETH) broke above the $253.556–$216.006 range on July 22.

218,"Blockchain technology has recently become a phenomenon in various areas of the economy, driving innovation, fostering growth and bringing added value. Among the most noteworthy of these sectors is the gaming industry. Gaming is a use case that drives true adoption of blockchain technology by taking the incentive for the user from pure speculation to transactions on a blockchain platform. This drives innovation in development as well as consumer adoption.The first true blockchain gaming application was Cryptokitties. While the platform itself is a technology demonstrator for collectible items, it quickly rose to prominence as the application representing the majority of transactions made on the Ethereum platform. Since its inception, the number of apps leveraging blockchain technology in gaming has exploded, with categories ranging from adventure games and card games to action games, role-playing games and casinos.Blockchain use cases in gaming are mainly constrained by the transaction capacity of blockchain platforms in case of Ethereum. Current blockchain applications in gaming, therefore, are experimental tickets, with collectible platforms and mobile games leading the pack.Card games are among the first games to use blockchain technology in gameplay. The unique feature presented by collectible cards is that the cards themselves, as nonfungible tokens, become tradeable items. Most of the time, the NFTs are traded on OpenSea. One of the most popular collectible card games using blockchain technology is Gods Unchained.Related: Overview and Market Trends of Crypto Games in 2020Real-time strategy, or RTS, and massively multiplayer online, or MMO, games are ideal genres for testing blockchain technology in gaming, as the gameplay allows for the creation of multiple asset types and smart contracts governing the rules of the games themselves. While successful titles in gaming are increasingly massively multiplayer, online and feature group dynamics, the application of blockchain technology in gaming is probably going to gain significant traction in this segment.Pixelmatic, a studio based in Shanghai and Vancouver that was founded by Samson Mow — current chief strategy officer of Blockstream and former director of production at Ubisoft — is working on a space-based MMO game with elements from the RTS genre and Eve Online and featuring a cryptocurrency for an in-game medium of exchange. While Eve Online features a marketplace for in-game goods, there’s no news yet about the further development of crypto-assets concerning in-game items. This is still pretty encouraging, and the game is the first step toward wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies among industry players in mainstream gaming.Related: Investing in Blockchain Gaming: Why VCs Are Betting BigOn Ethereum, games running on the blockchain risk spamming the network with transactions, increasing gas fees. Regardless, an increasing number of games are being developed to run on public blockchains themselves, creating an incentive to develop solutions to mitigate the subsequent flooding of the network. Proof-of-stake blockchains, sidechains and state channels may provide solutions to solve the issues underlying limited transaction speeds on proof-of-work blockchains currently deployed.The leading blockchain games this year are mostly card games, according to EsportsBets, with RTS games following closely behind. Big-ticket items are still either under development or being considered by larger studios, leaving a lot of room for garage studios to use their first-mover advantage and make their name before competition enters the market.Casinos have been among the first applications in gaming to adopt blockchain technology, with online casinos leading the pack. There are quite a number of blockchain-based online gambling sites, most of which offer superior quality and probability for the player compared with traditional, fiat-based casinos and gambling sites. Gambling is probably the most mature segment in blockchain-based gaming, and it is very likely to offer serious competition to traditional markets.With the appearance of senior developers and mostly open tools, blockchain gaming is unlocking previously unimaginable value for creators and gamers alike. For the first time, a truly open entertainment economy can be built.Speculation on platforms that may find blockchain applications and tokens useful in gaming is on the rise, and the platforms are often listed on top exchanges shortly after being released. With the continued development of easy-to-use user interfaces, standards for blockchain applications using relevant technologies to move transactions from PoW platforms to ones offering greater transaction speeds, and the release of items capturing the attention of audiences — acceptance by the mainstream is only a matter of time.Blockchain technology is especially suited for gaming, and gaming can directly benefit from blockchain technology, both technically as well as in unlocking value from in-game items, tournaments, character development and gamer recognition. This paves way for esports being a leader in the sports and entertainment sector, much like the internet is now. Today, traditional media is mostly run on the internet, so perhaps through blockchain technology, all sports could one day contain elements of esports.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Artem Kabanov is an entrepreneur with more than six years of experience.

219,"Since 2015, the blockchain industry has generated a variety of economic concepts and supported them with relevant technologies: initial coin offerings, initial exchange offerings, security token offerings, decentralized autonomous organization, permissioned ledgers, stablecoins, decentralized finance, etc. In a short time frame, some of these went all the way from their heydays to oblivion. Emerging concepts, like DeFi, and corporate stablecoins, e.g., Libra, are at risk of repeating this trajectory. Let’s be honest — the wishful dreams of many enthusiasts about global tokenomics are unlikely to happen in the nearest future. So, what’s wrong with these concepts?A few years ago, many naive investors easily bought into exhortations of “a unique financial and legal nature” of tokens and their relations. But when the hype cooled down, people started seeking answers about their legal rights and interests. Who needs tokens of corporate rights, securities and real estate, which are not pegged to real legal rights and obligations?Even stablecoins might not be so stable. In Clause 3 of Tether’s service agreement, the picky reader finds that Tether (USDT) tokens might be delayed in redemption to the user and even replaced with estate other than United States dollars. How would you react if you were trying to withdraw cash from your account, and the bank clerk said: “Sorry, we cannot give you your dollars back but bonds of ‘Company X’ instead, and not today, but in three months?”And if these securities have no value at all, it will be an absolutely legal transaction because the financial institution did not promise to return your money.Supposedly, the market will demand players to tie tokens they issue with legal obligations and liquid property rights at some point. So, investors may eventually convert their, say, three tokens into three square feet of property, or a block of crypto shares into corporate shares or crypto shares as the shares of that corporation.But there are some problems. Tokens are far from the reality of laws and legal rights because of the technical specifics. A blockchain is an append-only database of transactions, and retroactivity or access of third parties is impossible. Only the owner of the private key to the address where tokens are recorded can authorize further transactions. It causes a long list of legal considerations, but to make it clear, let us name the major ones.There is no way how a user: can inherit a token; can enforce a lawful court decision, for instance, to resolve a dispute; or can restore access if the private key is lost.If the token is the primary source of knowledge about your legal right for anything, you lose this right by losing access to this record, as you cannot dispose of it — i.e., perform any transaction. You cannot simply create another token to represent the same right. Any buyer will have legitimate doubts that someone else suddenly finds the private key to the lost token. Tokens representing the same right in the system will create a sort of double-spending problem. This model runs the risk of uncertainty in who owns what, and it is unlikely that massive tokenization will happen under these circumstances.To address these problems, some startups design ad hoc solutions, most of which are questionable. For example, a token issuer leaves a backdoor in the smart contract to manually resolve users’ disputes when they arise. Or tokens are used as an indication or intention for acquiring legal rights, but meanwhile, they are backed with traditional paper transactions. Why would anyone declare “decentralization and elimination of middlemen” to end up with a smart contract heavily relied on a third party? Or what is the value of such a token if not the token, but the paper that represents your rights? Who even needs these double standards? Why is blockchain technology needed at all if one can keep the ledger on a spreadsheet?To make the problems complex, we must add issues with digital identity and privacy. In the world of strict Know Your Customer rules, nobody wants to deal with pseudonym identities. However, the creation of identities on a blockchain is not an option — at least you cannot expose any personal data in open form. Once any data is published on the ledger, it cannot be erased.For the same reasons, it is believed that blockchain technology is intolerant to mistakes, and there is no way to correct them.Another consideration is scalability and price volatility. Many credible public blockchains cannot handle mass transactions. Transaction fees will inevitably increase, exacerbating the problem of price volatility of cryptocurrency. To run a smart contract or even a simple transaction, you will need some coins to spend. With rising fees and exchange rates, these expenses become unpredictable to plan.The first blockchain — Bitcoin — appeared as an uncensored decentralized distributed ledger. A permissioned ledger means that someone controls it, and I doubt it is correct to call such a system a blockchain. Therefore, let’s just call this type of technology “permissioned ledger.” Additionally, the stronghold of European technologies, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, uses this term in its report, omitting to call it “permissioned blockchain” contrary to their colleagues from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. Indeed, “permissioned blockchain” is a rhetorical oxymoron.The basic feature of blockchain technology is its openness and competitiveness. This is the real guarantee for the immutability of the ledger and double-spend protection. Decentralization is not a state; it is a dynamic process of the struggle of good and evil where the economic incentive of mining always wins. This component is normally absent in a permissioned (private, enterprise, federated, etc.) system where the control over the system is initially predesigned. And this system is granted not to sole control by one admin but shared among participants of a private consortium. For users and outside observers, this inner circle remains a closed and censored system where even retroactivity (altering transaction history) and erasure of transactions might be legitimate options.Permissioned blockchains are presented as an alternative to public blockchains, as they can address the aforementioned problems, but it is still too early to release blockchains, as permissioned systems raise the legitimate question of: Why is it better than any other centralized system? Especially when we are talking about traditional land registries and other public property registries that exist. Governments around the world have got used to traditional centralized systems, which they have been using as property databases for decades.This is part one of a three-part series on the theory of title token — read part two on cross-blockchain protocol and smart laws here, and part three on the new generation of public property registries here.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Oleksii Konashevych is the author of Cross-Blockchain Protocol for Government Databases: The Technology for Public Registries and Smart Laws.

220,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose to as high as $10,272 on July 26 in an unexpected weekend rally. It liquidated $74 million worth of long contracts on BitMEX alone, catching many traders off guard.The hourly price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comThere appear to be two main reasons behind the abrupt upsurge of Bitcoin from $9,700 to over $10,200. They are the liquidation of over-leveraged shorts and traders taking profit from over-extended alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).When the price started to rally, major altcoins, as well as well-performing DeFi tokens, began to slump. Ethereum declined from $322 to $311, and DeFi tokens, including Aave and YFI, saw steep rejections. Cryptocurrency market performance July 26. Source: Coin360The simultaneous rejections of major altcoins and the price surge of Bitcoin suggest that traders took profit from recent altcoin rallies. As traders moved their altcoin gains to Bitcoin, it possibly triggered a BTC uptrend, while altcoins declined.ETH, as an example, rose from $247 on July 23 to $322 on the day’s peak, recording a 30% gain. Despite the strong sentiment around altcoins, investors are possibly taking a more cautious approach by hedging their gains.When Bitcoin initially broke over $10,000, it triggered over-leveraged short contracts to become liquidated. When BTC reached $10,200, it caused a cascade of liquidations to occur, totaling $74 million.Bitcoin has seen many phases when more than $50 million worth of short or long contracts gets liquidated. But for this to occur within a span of a few hours is less typical.The mass liquidations of long contracts at $10,000 also suggest that the $10,000 to $10,200 remains as a heavy resistance area. As soon as BTC hit $10,200, the price dropped below $10,000, marking a short-lived rally.As the price of Bitcoin recovered strongly in recent weeks, some industry executives and investors expressed optimism toward BTC and ETH.“Are you ready?” Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert tweeted when Ether price broke out of the dreaded $280 resistance level on July 25.Well-known trader Peter Brandt, meanwhile, expects the price of Bitcoin to hit a new record high and eventually make its way to $50,000. He said:“That is actually where my head is. Massive symmetrical triangle in $BTC points to ATHs, then $50k.”But some variables could affect the short-term price trend of BTC price. First, the funding rate of Bitcoin is projected to be over 0.04% on BitMEX. That is nearly four times higher than the average funding rate of 0.01%. It signifies that the majority of the market is taking long positions.For Ethereum’s ETH token, the funding rate is hovering at over 0.1%, which suggests the rally is beginning to get overheated. In February, ETH’s price rejected at $280 as its funding rate surpassed 0.2%, and when the overwhelming majority of the market was longing the asset.Second, $10,000 has acted as a key psychological level for Bitcoin since October 2019. If BTC rejects at $10,200, it would still be lower than the previous peak in February 2020 at $10,473. Although it would be far-fetched to call it a lower high formation, it might show that BTC price has not cleanly broken out of the multi-month range."
221,"As the human race evolves, our means of exchanging value also continuously develops. From the barter system that dates back to 6,000 B.C. to the present-day use of fiat currency, the human race has been on a nonstop journey toward creating more efficient exchange methods. Factors such as convenience, availability, stability and sustainability have played crucial roles in the evolution of exchange methods.Fiat currency is essentially paper money backed solely by the government’s word and central bank regulations. It became the preferred method of exchange globally at the expense of other methods such as commodity-based currencies and barter. This was owing to its convenience, the relative stability of value and also because it is under government control. Fiat currencies gained prominence in the 20th century partly because governments sought to insulate their economies from the worst effects of the natural fluctuations of the business cycle.A fiat currency is a legal tender that has value based on the issuing government rather than physical assets. Hence, its value is only as good as the issuing government. Corrupt politicians and irresponsible governments have been culpable of printing excess money to cover up for their lapses. This results in an endless cycle of inflation or, worse yet, a recession. In 2019, Zimbabwe struggled with hyperinflation of more than 300% after a long period of political unrest.As the world became increasingly digital moving into the 21st century, the need for a secured digitized means of payment became inevitable. Banks and other financial institutions continued to adopt various digital payment methods. The blockchain breakthrough finally arrived in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper on what would become Bitcoin (BTC) — the first and most popular modern cryptocurrency.As a decentralized means of exchange, the elimination of third parties and central banks is undoubtedly the most significant advantage of cryptocurrency. Unlike fiat currencies, blockchain technology is a public ledger and is tightly regulated by a process called mining. This ensures that all money in circulation is accounted for, promoting transparency and accountability in the technology.Cryptocurrency edges out fiat currency in processing fast, reliable, efficient means of exchange, especially in a digitized world. However, the technology has to overcome some significant hurdles if it is ever to become more popular than traditional fiat currencies. Here are a few reasons why the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies is complicated:Governments and regulatory institutions are among the many barriers that cryptocurrency faces in its bid to emerge as a globally accepted means of exchange. Taxation on distributed ledger technology is complicated because it is independent of governments and traditional banking systems. Besides, politicians and governments can shape economies when they control money circulation. Consequently, by creating hostile policies and dissuading the use of cryptocurrencies, governments can keep a lid on their use and ultimately ensure the flow of fiat currency.Recently, Twitter suffered what could quite possibly be the worst hack since its inception. Celebrities, billionaires and multiple cryptocurrency exchanges were targeted and hacked. The hackers composed different messages asking people to send Bitcoin to a wallet address in order to receive double the amount back, and around $120,000 worth of BTC was lost to the scam.While the involvement of Bitcoin in the scam doesn’t tell even a quarter of the story, its use in fraud, scams and some dark web activity has been a deterrent to blockchain’s popularity.As previously mentioned, Bitcoin transactions are verified by a unique process called mining. Transactions on the distributed ledger are confirmed and stored as “blocks of information” by Bitcoin miners. However, mining is a complex and energy-consuming process that requires a high amount of power and energy generation. The University of Cambridge estimates that Bitcoin consumes 0.21% of the electricity the world produces, an amount close to the total electrical consumption of countries such as Romania, Bangladesh and Israel.As many mining farms all over the world seek to expand their operations to prepare for a future with cryptocurrencies, the big question remains — how sustainable is this energy-consuming process in the long term?Originally designed to process seven transactions per second, blockchain technology now faces a huge scalability problem. While the intention of Bitcoin’s developers was solely to prevent hackers from manipulating the technology, the transaction capacity simply can’t accommodate the enormous use of the blockchain.This would be complicated even further by an increase in industries and investors seeking to adopt the technology. While cryptocurrency experts have debated over the years whether to increase block size or use an exponential scaling-off approach, it remains to be seen whether and how the scalability problem can be put to bed.While the blockchain technology market is expected to be worth over $39 billion by 2025, its mainstream adoption and eventual replacement of fiat currencies may still be a massive reach. Cryptocurrencies certainly have a long way to go, and investors can sit back and watch how the technology unfolds shortly.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Joshua Esan is a freelance writer and editor passionate about blockchain technology and the health industry.

222,"It’s been a good week for Bitcoin. The dollar price is up more than 3 percent to around $9,500. That $10,000 ceiling is looking more fragile than ever. One sign that the ceiling may be about to break is the decline in Google searches for “Bitcoin.” According to Google Trends, search interest is the lowest since December 2019. Last time search interest fell by such a degree, the price climbed around 50 percent.One coin in which interest is running high—and putting up prices—is pennies. A slowdown in coin production caused by the coronavirus has led to a shortage of small change. The Community State Bank of Milwaukee is now offering a 5 percent premium to customers who bring in their coin jars. Meanwhile, there’s no shortage of Satoshis.Mastercard is doing its bit to promote a cashless economy: the company is trying to partner with cryptocurrency firms. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a banking regulator, has given permission to federally chartered banks to custody cryptocurrency. It’s nice that they’re offering. And former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair, J. Christopher Giancarlo, has told a Senate banking committee’s subcommittee that the US should be running pilot programs to develop a digital dollar. On the other hand, South Korea has introduced a 20 percent tax rate for income produced by crypto-trading. That’s what happens when governments get to grips with cryptocurrencies.A digital dollar would have to be secure, though, because plenty of fraudsters and bad actors are trying to make off with and use digital currencies. Coinbase managed to stop more than 1,000 customers sending about $280,000 worth of Bitcoin to the Twitter hackers. In Argentina, the country’s largest telco has been the victim of a $7.5 million Monero ransomware attack. And in an appalling case in Italy, two teenagers were arrested for allegedly watching the live online torture of children. They’re said to have paid for the stream with Bitcoin. Ethereum, though, is trying to recruit hackers. The foundation has set up two networks for hackers to attack in exchange for a bug bounty. The hackers might find that the networks are protected by a Thing or two. Dr. Seuss’s famous characters, including the Lorax, the Cat in the Hat, and Thing One and Thing Two, are now available from Dapper Labs, the company that brought you Cryptokitties. If more music were available for cryptocurrencies, customers would also use them to give musicians a bigger split. And in South Africa, the Divi Project Community raised 67,000 DIVI to mark Nelson Mandela’s 67 years of humanitarian work.

223,"Last month, the United States Congress increased the tax benefits of charitable giving in the CARES Act in hopes that people will give more. Some give money; others give property; and a growing number have been giving crypto assets.Once you have made the difficult decision of which charity or cause to donate to, your focus should shift toward your tax position. There are certain things to keep in mind when giving crypto assets — particularly considering how their volatility can affect your taxes and decision making.Generally, giving a gift of crypto does not trigger a taxable event to the donors or to the recipients. Thus, after donors decide how much they wish to give, they must also decide which assets to give. Donating assets with a low tax basis can reduce or minimize future taxable income, as the donor retains assets with a higher tax basis. Entities that are exempt from U.S. tax due to their educational, charitable or other activities (“charity”) are often indifferent toward the tax basis of the assets they receive. This is because they are normally exempt from taxes on gains from assets sold to fund their charitable activities.If the recipient of the gift is not exempt from U.S. tax — i.e., a “non-charity” — they will likely care about the tax basis of the asset given to them. This is because the donor’s tax basis on gifted assets often — but not always — transfers to the non-Charity. Thus, if the donor wishes to prioritize their own tax position over the non-charity’s, the donor will give crypto with the lowest tax basis. Conversely, if the donor wishes to prioritize the benefits of the gift to the non-Charity, they will give crypto with the highest tax basis.Crypto assets have a built-in loss because their tax basis is higher than their current market value; therefore, a donor may wish to sell the crypto for cash (to realize a capital loss) and then give that cash to a charity or non-charity. The donor can use this capital loss to offset tax on any capital gains they may have while transferring the same value to the charity or non-charity.If a donor gives a gift of crypto with a built-in loss to a non-charity, the potential tax deduction from the built-in loss is lost. This is because the general rule that transfers the donor’s tax basis to the gift recipient does not apply in the case of built-in-loss assets that a gift recipient sells for a loss. Rather, the tax basis of the property sold by the gift recipient is limited to the fair market value of the assets at the time of the gift.Individuals who itemize deductions may be entitled to a deduction for gifts of crypto they make to certain charities. Entitlement to the deduction is given when an individual’s itemized deductions exceed their standard deduction — i.e., $12,400 for single taxpayers and $24,800 for married taxpayers. However, even if an individual does not meet these thresholds, they may be entitled to a deduction of up to $300 as a result of the CARES Act enacted in March. The act also reduced other limitations on an individual’s ability to take a deduction for charitable contributions.Often, the amount of a charitable deduction is based on the fair market value of the crypto asset at the time of donation. However, if an individual donates either crypto assets with short-term gains (less than one year) or crypto that would give rise to ordinary income if sold, then the taxpayer’s charitable deduction is reduced by any appreciation in the crypto. This can limit a taxpayer’s charitable deduction to the tax basis of the crypto given.More and more charities are partnering with crypto payment/donation platforms, such as BitPay, Coinbase Commerce and The Giving Block to facilitate donations made in crypto. Although many of the largest charities already accept donations made in crypto — e.g., United Way, American Red Cross, No Kid Hungry — only about 2% of all nonprofit organizations in the U.S. and Canada have been reportedly doing so.For those who still want to donate crypto assets to organizations that do not accept them, one option may be a donor-advised fund, also known as a donor fund. One of the largest donor funds in the U.S. is Fidelity Charitable. It accepts donations in Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and XRP. As Fidelity Charitable and other donor funds are charities, the same considerations outlined in this article apply when contributing to these funds.After receiving the donated crypto, the donor fund is able to sell the crypto for cash without having to pay tax. The whole fiat value — net of fees — of the crypto that is sold is able to grow in the donor fund or be donated to any charity of the donor’s choice (hence the donor-advised reference). Although donor funds have funding/donation minimums, they can provide additional options for those looking to make donations with their crypto holdings. Fidelity Charitable, alone, since 2015 has received $100 million in cryptocurrency donations, according to its recently published “2019 Giving Report.”After deciding which charity or non-charity deserves your gift, your own tax position may deserve some thought as well. Although there are some twists and turns in the thought process, it all starts by asking some basic questions around whether the crypto you are giving has appreciated or depreciated and the nature of the gift’s recipient. Thinking about both tax and non-tax considerations of a gift can maximize the overall benefits to the donor and the recipient, or at least put the donor in control of striking the right balance.This article is for general informational purposes only and should not be treated as providing advice on the tax, accounting or other treatment of a transaction or activity.

224,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) held the crucial support level of $9,000, after which a rally to $9,600 occurred, as anticipated in last week’s technical analysis. Nevertheless, the overall market trend for BTC price has not broken out of its range since the halving in May.The support area is $8,800-9,000, while the resistance can be found between $10,100-10,300. The volatility and volume have been decreasing as this range has been narrowing. So when can the market see volatility and big moves again?Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360As the chart shows, the crucial support levels for Bitcoin were held this past week. The support area between $8,800-9,000 was a vital one to hold as this was the previous low.BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe primary reason this was a key support level is because of the upward trend structure. As long as the price makes higher lows, the uptrend remains valid. If the price of Bitcoin loses the previous low, the price would start to accelerate downward. The likelihood of many stop/loss triggers getting hit is high, increasing the chances of a $1,000 downward candle.However, the price of Bitcoin bounced after holding the crucial support level. Thus, the ascending triangle construction remains intact. Moreover, the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs) are beneath the current price level. As long as these remain below the price, BTC is in bull territory.Finally, as the ascending triangle construction shows, the price of Bitcoin can remain inside the range for one or two months more.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows a clear breakout of the $9,200 resistance level, resulting in a significant upward move. BTC/USD is currently resting at the $9,650 resistance level as this level was untested during the previous downturn.As stated previously, a major parabolic is unlikely to happen so soon, as the price has some more untested levels above, namely $9,900 and $10,100.The most likely scenario would be a “staircase” pattern. In that regard, the price of Bitcoin rallies towards the resistance zone rejects and then successfully tests the previous resistance zone for support. Next, the price move is likely to accelerate upward once Bitcoin breaks above the high of $10,100.Total crypto market capitalization 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe total crypto market capitalization shows a clear breakout from $270 billion. This level is comparable to the $10,100 level for Bitcoin. However, the total market cap is breaking out already, while Bitcoin is still stuck in its narrow range.Overall, the bullish case remains for the total cryptocurrency market cap if the support level between $265-270 billion holds.Total altcoin market capitalization 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe total market capitalization is breaking out already while Bitcoin is range-bound because many altcoins have been breaking out across the board.Recently, altcoins have been doing relatively better than Bitcoin as some are showing impressive gains. Even Ether (ETH) broke out substantially over the past week as it surged from $245 to $285.The chart is showing a clear uptrend for the altcoin market cap, which has been making higher highs and higher lows. The previous resistance zone at $100 billion should provide strong support for the next move up toward $125 billion.BTC/USDT 4-hour bullish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bullish scenario can be divided into two separate parts. The first one is an immediate breakthrough of the $9,650 level, after which the next zone to be tested is $9,900.The second one is a corrective move down toward $9,300, after which the price continues upward. In this scenario, it can be expected that a potential trap above $9,650 occurs during the weekend. Weekend times are usually full of traps in the markets, where fake-out moves are not uncommon.The crucial support level to hold as support is preferably $9,300. However, the $9,200 area is a make-or-break level as that’s the recent low. If the current low is lost, the complete technical structure breaks and the market is ready for further downside.BTC/USDT 2-day chart. Source: TradingViewTherefore, the most likely scenario would be a grind upward to the massive resistance zone around $10,000. As the trendline and the chart are showing, this upward momentum can last for several weeks or months before a substantial breakout occurs.In the case of a breakout above $10,000, a substantial surge in price becomes likely. The first resistance zone is found at $12,000, while a rally toward $15,000 should also not be ruled out.BTC/USDT 4-hour bearish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bearish scenario is pretty straightforward. A rejection at retest would, therefore, cause a drop toward $9,300.The difference between the bullish and bearish scenarios would be a further downward continuation with failed retests of support levels.For instance, more downside becomes likely if Bitcoin’s price makes a jump towards $9,500, but instantly rejects that level and loses $9,300 immediately after. These bearish rejections are crucial to watch if the price of Bitcoin starts to correct.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

225,"China-based mining pool Btc.top wants to upgrade the concept of cloud mining, which allows users to mine crypto remotely by buying a certain amount of hash power from a third-party, with what it calls “joint mining.”Announced on July 25, the company’s new “joint mining” subsidiary B.top aims to reduce the risks associated with “popular cloud mining products” by offering more flexibility.Specifically, B.top claims to charge service and maintenance fees to its users only after they have reached the break-even point, meaning that its customers start to share profits when their revenue is equal to the cost they initially paid to purchase the equipment. According to the company, it then starts to charge from 17.5% to 30%, depending on how much their customers invested.In addition, the B.top claims to be offering mining equipment “at bulk order prices,” allowing users to either purchase shares in single miners, depending on how much terahash (TH) of hash rate they want to own or buy those machines in whole. The latter option supposedly allows the customers to withdraw their equipment from B.top’s mining farms located across China and have it shipped to a destination of their choice, or re-sell their miners back to the company at the resale market price.“I estimate that other industrial scale mining companies would also soon start offering similar joint mining products,” Btc.top founder and CEO Jiang Zhuoer told Cointelegraph, adding that he expects the offer to be popular among both retail and institutional clients:“Although B.TOP is aimed at making it easier for individuals to participate in cryptocurrency mining, I believe that it would also attract institutional clients from around the world who would like to take advantage of our industrial scale infrastructure, strategic industry partnerships and lowest electricity rates from our data centers across China.”According to Zhuoer, some of B.top’s joint mining users in China, where they premiered this program back in March, are willing to invest up to 10-20 million RMB, or $1.4 — 2.8 million. Now, the platform has launched internationally.B.top claims to charge around 3.3 US cents per kilowatt-hour, although it seems that the price can change once the rainy season in Sichuan is over since at least some of its mining farms are located there. Users are charged for the electricity their equipment consumes throughout the whole program.While China is currently responsible for as much as 65% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate, according to the Bitcoin Mining Map developed by Cambridge center for alternative finance, some countries choose to crack down on the activity.Earlier this month, Venezuela, which occupies the 10th spot on the said map, banned crypto mining from state-owned housing."
226,"China leads the development of central bank digital currency (CBDC ) in the world. Digital yuan has been already tested in some areas in China while Western nations have just started talking about CBDCs.Six central banks such as ECB, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, are collaborating on the research of CBDC and reportedly held the first meeting just in April. Bank of Japan announced at the beginning of this month that they would start testing a digital yen although they didn’t specify when. The United States hasn’t even started officially talking about it. Last month, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell didn’t reveal any concrete progress on the digital dollar.So, it seems that nothing is stopping the development of Chinese digital yuan.However, Takaya Nakamura, an executive from the Japanese crypto exchange Fisco firmly believes that digital yuan will not prevail because of “the China dream.”The China dream is a political slogan that President Xi Jinping revealed in 2012. It is a nationalistic slogan with the aim to achieve the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Nakamura claimed that the China dream would hinder the mass adoption of digital yuan.“I don’t think digital yuan will prevail,” he says.As China, “the world’s factory”, is removed from the supply chains in the world due to the economic slowdown by the COVID-19 pandemic and American bashing, they will further strengthen the China dream to fuel patriotism and go through the crisis. This, according to Nakamura, leads to further isolation of China in the world’s economy.Nakamura stated:“Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has to keep emphasizing the China dream otherwise they can’t maintain their unifying force and will be collapsed. But if they do it too much they will further isolate themselves in the world and lose their economic competitiveness. This is a negative spiral.”According to Nakamura, as China gets removed from the world trading networks they will lose foreign currency reserves. Having enough foreign currency reserves will be crucial as China needs a transition time for digital yuan to break the US dollar hegemony.“As long as you live in the time of US dollar hegemony, having foreign currency reserves is very important. Losing it will eventually make it difficult for China to push forward digital yuan.”Nakamura concludes that China will have a chance only if the United States handles the situation horribly and does nothing during China’s transition time for digital yuan."
227,"The very first Bitcoin (BTC) ATM came to the United States in 2014 to Austin, Texas. This historic event occurred quickly after Canada pioneered the idea in 2013, and the excitement and demand for such ATMs have soared across the globe ever since. There are currently over 8,000 BTC ATMs in more than 70 countries worldwide. In fact, the highest number of Bitcoin ATMs was recorded in the U.S. in 2020, and as of April 2020, approximately 81% of global ATMs were concentrated in North America.Two types of Bitcoin ATMs exist, with one being more complex than the other. The more basic one simply enables users to purchase Bitcoin, whereas the more complex one provides the function of both buying and selling. These new-age machines have sky-rocketed in popularity, overtaking Bitcoin exchanges as a preference for many. The exchange of fiat for Bitcoin is now a seamless procedure, with Bitcoin ATMs offering a fast and user-friendly experience. This all sounds great — but how can ATM operators buy a machine and set it up in their desired location?There is just one thing we haven’t mentioned until now — compliance. Bitcoin ATM operators need to ensure a comprehensive compliance framework that appeases Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations, as well as other laws on a federal and state level. Without necessary compliance measures fully in place, Bitcoin ATM operators will be forced to shut down. In short, compliance is key.It’s crucial to understand that regulation for Bitcoin ATMs varies from state to state — some states are more welcoming than others. New York has much stricter requirements than Texas, for example. These differences are abundant and are constantly updated.For example, in some states, money transmitter requirements declare that you must acquire a money transmitter license. Any operator without a license is committing an imprisonable offense, even if it has completed every other step toward compliance. Therefore, it’s important to research the specific states in which you are operating to avoid any difficulty.The federal regulations relating to Bitcoin ATMs are outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA. This law requires all financial institutions, including Bitcoin ATMs, to assist U.S. government agencies in both detecting and preventing money laundering. Therefore, Bitcoin ATMs must adhere to the regulations of the BSA and rules relating to AML. As mentioned above, both federal and state laws must be followed. For this reason, it is crucial that you research the law in the specific states that you operate in, too.In the U.S., Bitcoin ATMs are considered Money Services Businesses and, therefore, are subject to the regulation of the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. Every Bitcoin ATM operator must register as an MSB with FinCEN.FinCEN is the U.S.’ financial intelligence unit and arbiter of federal AML laws. Registration is a simple step that involves registering via the online portal with a basic “check-the-box” process. By registering with FinCEN, you are essentially agreeing to be regulated by the entity. This also includes registering at a state level and developing an AML program in most cases, retaining transactional information and reporting any suspicious activity. For state-level regulation, you must complete a permission-based state licensing process.Once registered with FinCEN, operators must comply with the BSA as outlined above. This involves a Bitcoin ATM operator establishing and implementing an anti-money laundering compliance program — a written document that explains an operator’s overall plan to prevent its Bitcoin ATMs from facilitating money laundering activities. An AML program must address a minimum of five pillars, as outlined below:Before going live, it’s important for operators to test all AML controls. This can be done by conducting some sample transactions through the machines. It’s imperative to take this opportunity to ensure that the appropriate KYC processes and suspicious activity indicators are in place and functioning.In addition, check that customer and transaction information is properly recorded. Any issues found during testing and any relevant changes or solutions introduced to address these problems should also be recorded.There has been a huge stigma around Bitcoin ATMs because they are considered to be a vehicle for money laundering, with bad actors using the machines to clean cash quickly and easily. Removing this stigma and thwarting this negative reputation still remains a challenge today. However, with ATM operators following the above steps and complying with required regulation, this negative reputation can be alleviated and, hopefully, one day eradicated.Honest, hardworking Bitcoin ATM producers and operators can play an integral role in creating this bright future, but compliance is something that cannot be ignored. Compliance is a core foundation of the Bitcoin ATM industry and must be adhered to accordingly. Compliance is not a one-time checkbox and, therefore, should be updated regularly. It is in the interest of your users to take responsibility and to be fully compliant both at a federal and state level.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Bo Oney is the executive vice president of operations and head of compliance at Coinsource and is a certified anti-money laundering specialist.

228,"As the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, history seemingly repeated itself as familiar public health strategies were gradually implemented from one jurisdiction to the next. From recommendations of social distancing to lockdowns, such measures have disrupted even the most benign day-to-day activities, prompting small but meaningful changes in how we work, live, pay and play.From QR code payments to mobile wallets, the appeal of cashless payment methods has increasingly been institutionalized even in Southeast Asian markets where cash has historically reigned as king. The move is promising, considering that over 70% of adults still lack access to basic financial services in the region. With the goal of attaining greater financial inclusion, these infrastructures have the potential to bring about long-standing changes. When coupled with emerging technologies such as blockchain, a new breed of legacy financial infrastructures can be transformed to better serve those in need.If the last few months are any indication, the willing acceptance of innovative financial technologies is intrinsic to shaping Southeast Asia’s next digital financial revolution. So, where do we go from here?Crises have the power to enact great change. This narrative is far from unfamiliar, harkening back to the seismic growth of China’s digital payments and e-commerce scene taking place in tandem with the aftermath of the 2003 SARS outbreak. Today, of course, China is home to a vibrant e-payment ecosystem dominated by tech giants such as Alipay and WeChat Pay.In developed markets such as Singapore, where a sophisticated network of digital payment options exists, the coronavirus simply served as an accelerant for increased adoption. As part of the government’s public health strategy, the Monetary Authority of Singapore encouraged the use of e-payment infrastructures such as the islandwide SG QR code system to mobile e-wallets to enable social distancing and contactless transactions. In the first quarter of 2020 alone, the number of e-payment transactions doubled in the city-state. This behavioral change in payment preferences has taken place on a multi-generational level with banking customers over the age of 54 expressing increased confidence in online banking services throughout the pandemic.Meanwhile, other developing economies have seen the coronavirus as a much-needed catalyst for urgent change. No longer able to lag behind their developed counterparts, it’s here where the enabling impact of financial technologies has been especially pronounced. According to Thailand’s central bank, digital payments in the country increased by 93% in March compared to the year before — a dramatic increase for a country where 90% of all transactions were still predominantly conducted with cash. Meanwhile, Indonesia — dubbed as “APAC’s most valuable untapped e-money market” — still struggles with a sizable unbanked population, standing at 66% as of 2018. Today, it’s now home to 37 local e-payment methods, and the government’s standardized QRIS QR code payment system is expected to bridge the financial inequality gap further.Despite the economic strain triggered by the global health crisis, emerging markets stand to gain a great deal by living by the motto of “go digital or die” in a bid to drive a tech-enabled model of greater financial and social mobility.The culture of open finance is one that needs to begin from the top-down in order to promote a more collaborative ecosystem where fintech companies can work with traditional banks to offer better payment infrastructures, seamless Know Your Customer procedures and transparent operations. Yet, there are certainly opportunities to take it one step further.On an institutional level, the acceptance of emerging technologies such as blockchain can promote and make the financial ecosystem even more open. Enabled by high-grade security standards through cryptography, blockchain technology can power even more innovative financial instruments that are future-fit by design. Across emerging markets that aren’t burdened by legacy banks, the appetite for innovation at this scale is clear.Meanwhile, jurisdictions such as Singapore have taken on a pro-innovation approach to introducing blockchain technology to the local financial ecosystem. This July, the Monetary Authority of Singapore released its fifth and final report for Project Ubin, highlighting the commercial viability of a blockchain-based multi-currency payments network. Pointing to existing synergies with other industries that would benefit from the use of a transparent, immutable ledger to facilitate payments, Project Ubin attests to the long-term viability of blockchain technology for a broad base of financial use cases. Often positioned as one of the region’s leaders in financial innovation, the step that Singapore has taken is likely to set a precedent for the rest of Southeast Asia in the years to come.Be it trade finance or cross-border transfers, there’s certainly room for collaboration between the incumbents and challengers of the status quo as the region continues to mature. Amid the backdrop of the coronavirus, what the last few months have shown is that the capacity for real and meaningful change is there within the financial ecosystem. In a region that’s home to 10% of the world’s total internet user base and ever-growing smartphone penetration rates, it’s clear that the region is primed for a digital-first future.Whether it’s in developed markets that have taken on a progressive stance or emerging markets free from the binds of traditional players, that Southeast Asia’s financial services space will be characterized by accessibility and choice. With the presence of blockchain technology, we’re sure to see more exciting institutional use cases on the horizon as the region continues its open financial journey.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Kenneth Bok is the head of growth and strategy at Zilliqa.

230,"Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch appears to be ramping up its crypto strategy. The site, which focuses primarily on video game livestreaming, is now offering users a 10% subscription discount when paying with cryptocurrency through the platform’s payment processor, BitPay.BitPay’s chief marketing officer, Bill Zielke, told Cointelegraph that out of the thousands of merchants the company works with, Twitch is the first major global brand to offer a crypto-based promotion. Zielke added:“We are seeing more online merchants interested in using crypto as a promotional payment form, which is exciting since most marketing payment options are mainly reserved for alternative payments through PayPal. [...] Twitch is the first major merchant to jump on this trend.”According to Zielke, it is Twitch that’s offering the 10% subscription discount, which is important to note because some may think the promotional offer comes from BitPay. The fact that Twitch itself is offering the promotion is quite surprising, as the streaming platform appears to have a love-hate relationship with crypto.In March 2019, Twitch removed its Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) payment options for subscriptions. A Reddit user reported the change, noting that Twitch suddenly removed BitPay as a payment processor. Another Reddit user pointed out that Twitch canceled all their crypto-based subscriptions during this time. Three months later, Twitch reenabled crypto payment options. While Zielke was unable to comment on Twitch’s sudden change of heart toward crypto in 2019, he mentioned that Twitch clearly wants to attract more crypto users to the platform. “When a company as large as Twitch offers a cryptocurrency-based promotion for all its customers, this sends a clear message that they are serious about it,” he said.Speculation would also lead some to believe that Twitch’s growing interest in crypto stems from the increasing popularity of blockchain-based games and the use of digital assets in virtual worlds. With this in mind, it’s important to point out that Twitch caters primarily to the gaming community. Recent statistics further show that over 16,000 games were played on Twitch at the beginning of July, which appears to be close to the all-time high for the platform. Trip Hawkins, a gaming pioneer and independent board member for DMarket — a platform for blockchain-based games — told Cointelegraph that he believes crypto will steadily increase in importance over the coming years, notably as a theme in games featuring virtual goods economies and within other game-related services:“Games are virtual worlds, and virtual worlds benefit from the trustworthiness of more currencies and reliable methods of payment. They also stand to benefit from the ownership and tracking mechanisms that crypto is known for. Hence, digital merchants will want to offer crypto as long as it is not too volatile an instrument (for that reason, we have seen it come and go a few times already).”Hawkins further noted that another trend many livestreaming platforms are adopting is using crypto for tipping. In December 2019, mobile payments service MenaPay announced support for Twitch tipping using its MenaCash stablecoin. The decentralized internet browser Brave also supports tipping on both YouTube and Twitch. The founder and CEO of DMarket, Vlad Panchenko, also told Cointelegraph that he believes Twitch is building a next-generation interactive platform, not only for gamers but also for other entertainment sectors such as the sports industry, increasing Twitch’s audience and overall engagement: “This is a perfect example of how gaming companies are predicting the future by re-positioning and re-structuring their offers with cryptocurrency.”Hawkins additionally pointed out that following the cryptocurrency market crash in March, crypto prices have recovered and even stabilized. As such, using crypto as a form of payment for online subscriptions may now be optimal. Echoing Hawkins, Zielke noted that while the cryptocurrency-based promotion offered by Twitch is a bold move, this demonstrates an even larger trend, with more merchants starting to seek and accept crypto-based payments. According to Zielke, BitPay commissioned a study by Forrester Consulting to show the benefits merchants can receive when accepting crypto payments. Although the study has not yet been released, Zielke was able to share some findings:“We found that accepting crypto delivers higher average order values, often 2–2.5 times higher. We also found that accepting crypto attracts new customer segments and lowers payments costs. Also, it’s often the case that half the cost of traditional pay methods accepting crypto nearly eliminates fraud-related chargebacks.”Stephan Widmer, CEO of European furniture e-commerce site Beliani, told Cointelegraph that the company previously partnered with BitPay on a campaign where customers received 100 euros (currently $116 dollars) off purchases of 400 euros ($465) or more when they paid with crypto. He explained that the objective behind the promotion was to attract a new customer base while increasing sales from higher-value orders. According to Widmer, results from the campaign show average order values to be about two times higher compared with sales from credit cards.Related: Biggest Corporations Sceptical of Introducing Crypto Payment OptionAlthough these findings may indicate big strides for cryptocurrency adoption in the payments industry, many challenges still remain. For instance, crypto is still a foreign concept for many retailers, causing most to shy away from it. Also, the volatility associated with crypto can be problematic for merchants. Michelle O’Connor, vice president of marketing for digital payments platform Uphold, told Cointelegraph that there are still strides that need to be made in order for cryptocurrency payments to gain mainstream adoption. O’Connor said:“When you look at the crypto industry and progress made over the past 6–12 months to jump the rails from speculation to mainstream adoption, it’s promising but there is still a ways to go and improvements to be made. When deciding how to invest in cryptocurrency, there are two camps, the hodlers and the consumers. Up until recently, there were very few easy ways for consumers to spend their crypto, or a hesitancy to spend because of the speculative nature and market volatility.”Yet O’Connor noted that hesitancy toward spending crypto is starting to fade away, especially as the United States experiences a devaluation of the dollar. Moreover, the benefits associated with cryptocurrency payments are starting to be realized by both merchants and major credit card providers like Mastercard. “By removing the merchant fees, settlement times and risk of chargeback, businesses should all be looking at their current accepted form of payment and open up to the world of crypto,” O’Connor said."
231,"The Republic of Abkhazia is witnessing a surge in crypto mining activities despite crypto-related activities being illegal since 2018. Customs have reported that mining hardware worth over $589,000 has crossed the border over the past six months.According to Nuzhnaya Gazeta, importing crypto mining rigs remains legally permissible. Importers are required to pay taxes equal to 1% of the hardware’s worth and a VAT of 10%.The largely unrecognized state in the South Caucasus, which is considered by several countries as an “autonomous republic” of Georgia, states that they’ve earned over $84,100 in taxes just from crypto mining rig imports since the start of 2020.Guram Inapshba, the head of the national customs committee, stated that they allow the imports in order to “hunt” for illegal crypto miners.Inapshba clarifies that no foreigners are involved inside the country in terms of running or funding crypto mining activities, but he says that there are “several dozen citizens” of Abkhazia involved in the imports.In December 2018, the government banned all crypto mining activities, citing a lack of capacity in the country’s electrical system. They also noted the need to provide “priority power supply to the population of Abkhazia.”Recently, the Bolivarian National Guard of Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, seized 315 Bitcoin (BTC) mining machines manufactured by Bitmain. The owners of the mining rigs were told that they did not possess the necessary permits to own and operate the machines."
232,"There are few indicators capable of accurately detecting professional traders’ sentiment on Bitcoin (BTC). To ascertain whether or not market participants are positioned in a bullish or bearish manner, analysts usually rely on technical analysis and derivatives markets, although those usually mix retail flow.  More recently some exchanges created internal metrics exclusively measuring top traders positions. Looking at exchange-provided data highlighting traders’ long-to-short positioning, one can see that the indicator currently shows a 30-day high on the long/short positions at Binance. Despite launching its futures platform only ten months ago, Binance is a top-5 contender with $430 million BTC open interest. A similar long/short ratio has been observed at Huobi futures.Bitcoin futures and options markets corroborate such a favourable thesis by displaying a positive contango and a negative skew. By combining three indicators (top traders positions, options skew, and futures contango) there is indisputable evidence that professional traders are bullish in the short-term.The Binance net long/short notional exposure of its top BTC/USDT futures top traders typically favors longs but the indicator now stands at its highest level.

This indicator improved from a neutral 2% rate earlier this month.Skew is a useful metric for gauging professional traders’ sentiment through options pricing. By comparing the implied volatility of put and call options, one can assert whether it is more costly to buy call (bullish) or put (bearish) options.Bitcoin 1-month options 25% delta skew. Source: SkewThe chart above shows that the 1-month options 25% delta skew has just flipped to the negative side. A negative indicator means implied volatility for calls is more significant than puts, signaling a higher insurance cost for a favorable price move.Although this is not necessarily a bullish indicator by itself (as other factors might influence options pricing), this trend change is unarguably an indicator of professional traders' positive sentiment.Currently the top traders net positions, options skew, and futures contango signify short-term bullish sentiment from professional traders. Adding to this, as all the indicators turned bullish, Bitcoin price showed strength by breaking the $9,400 resistance on July 22.Large and savvy traders seem to be betting that the $10,000 level could be tested earlier than expected.

233,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced economies to a halt and stretched the central banking system. Central banks have been printing money on a scale like never before, which makes the 2008 financial crisis pale in comparison. Over $2 trillion dollars were printed to stabilize the markets and increase liquidity.Back in 2008, Bitcoin (BTC) was created in reaction to these quantitative easing programs as an alternative to fiat currencies and the traditional financial systems. Where governments can print money at will, a numerus clausus asset class is attractive as an inflationary hedge.In 2008, the financial crisis began with disruption to the United States real estate and financial markets, only spreading to the financial and real economy in the rest of the world after a certain time delay. The COVID-19 outbreak is different in that it exerts a more radical and abrupt effect — first an economic upheaval by putting the real economy out of action immediately and completely, and then culminating in a financial crisis.Central banks globally have printed trillions in the first wave of COVID-19, with many more expected to come. Airbags have been deployed, whether it be direct deposits for the survival of individuals or new loans for the survival of businesses. A large amount of liquidity has been injected into monetary systems, with a sizable portion of it finding its way to the equity markets. The same will eventually happen to the crypto markets, but that hasn’t happened yet.The birth of guaranteed income is a result of central banks fighting the crisis with financial instruments — Bitcoin played no part in it. In fact, a hard money system, like what gold was during the great depression, can be detrimental during times of acute crisis. The market crash of 1929 became the economic depression of the 1930’s by way of a monetary transmission — gold was simply held as a store of value.Crypto market participants should be familiar with the supply-and-demand dynamics causing the current equity markets rally. After all, there are neither economic asset-backing nor earnings models in the crypto realm — prices are driven purely by market supply and demand. With the influx of new money fueling demand in the equity markets, what we are witnessing is the inflation of financial assets, and a floating of the haves, combined with deflation of economic assets, and a needed rescue of the have-nots.Modern monetary tools are flexible, swift, broad and powerful — it is logical that they are being deployed. The arguments we often hear from the Twitter peanut gallery that “Bitcoin solves this” are just misguided if not financially illiterate. In an age of abundance, paradoxically, Bitcoin simply does not and cannot deploy emergency funds to avoid starvation and civil unrest. To argue in a time of public suffering for hard money almost appears to be one of ignorant if not malignant sociopathy. Forget that Bitcoin isn’t money, much less hard money. Instead of tilting at central bank windmills, crypto would do well to focus on what it does well — as a speculative store of value.Bitcoin’s resilience, in this regard, will become more evident when the COVID-19 dust settles. Cryptocurrencies have held their own on the aspect of wealth preservation and growth, but their benefits have traditionally been limited to the fortunate few who already have exposure. That is, however, changing.With all the liquidity entering the markets and the finite number of Bitcoin, market participants have been increasingly bullish on the crypto — it’s just market number logic. We will likely witness a surge in money flows into crypto markets, similar to what we saw in the equity markets. This is narrowly financial — cryptos did well amid a financial panic.On a higher level, open-source blockchains are possibly philosophical constructs to the future of data, personal data, voting data and medical data. Today, we focus on investments and banking. Stablecoins offer downside protection, others offer very volatile growth, and some others are hybrids of the two.What can crypto do? It can serve as a transnational store of value, offering both downside protection and upside potential, and it does that well. Does it solve the economic and financial crisis unfolding? No. Crypto is an epiphenomenon on the world monetary stage. It may one day take center stage if it sheds its illusions and keeps executing.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Marc Fleury is the CEO and co-founder of Two Prime — a financial technology company that focuses on the financial application of crypto to the real economy.

235,"Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives have returned to the spotlight this week as price moves appear to spark a surge in open interest.Data from on-chain analytics resource Skew showed open interest for CME Group’s Bitcoin futures nearing record highs in U.S. dollar terms this week.After falling following Bitcoin’s block subsidy halving in May, the downtrend continued through last month before rebounding over the past seven days.Daily volume easily topped $300 million during the week, while open interest passed $450 million and was on course to top its all-time high of $532 million at press time.Open interest refers to the total value of derivatives contracts that have yet to be settled. High open interest coupled with low volume tends to suggest a speculative setup among investors, and the rebound in volume provides a reassuring sign that a sell-off may be averted.This week alone, however, open interest has soared by more than 30% as BTC/USD reclaims support levels at around $9,500.CME Bitcoin futures 6-month chart. Source: SkewAs Cointelegraph reported, institutional investor activity has once again become a topic of interest for analysts.

236,"Ned Davis, who has operated his namesake Wall Street research firm since 1980, believes a Nasdaq bubble is forming. Based on the rough correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and stocks in recent months, it could negatively affect the crypto market.Since March 2020, Bitcoin and the S&P 500 saw an uncanny correlation. There were some periods where BTC was stagnant during a stock market rally, especially from May to June. But for the most part, the correlation has remained high. On July 9, the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 reached an all-time high at 0.38.The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 in the past year. Source: Skew.comAnalysts expressed concerns about the over-valuation of tech stocks since early July. If the tech-heavy Nasdaq begins to fade, it could cause a larger stock market downtrend.Lisa Abramowicz, a business reporter at Bloomberg, wrote:“Tech valuations are the most extreme they've been since the 2000 tech bubble, based on the ratio of Nasdaq to small-cap stocks.”Data shows that tech stocks account for nearly 50% of the Nasdaq Composite index. Hence, when tech stocks decline, the Nasdaq Composite index drops, especially hard.Davis described the current situation of the Nasdaq 100 as “bubbly,” drawing concerns about the performance of FAANG and tech stocks. He noted that stocks like Microsoft dropped sharply after earnings, as internet and software companies are still reeling from the impact of the coronavirus lockdowns by governments across the globe.“The Nasdaq 100 looks bubbly to me,” he said. “If this isn’t a sign of climbing up a high diving board for speculation, I don’t know what is.”In the near-term, a slump in the stock market could catalyze a minor Bitcoin price pullback. Although Bitcoin has been uncorrelated during some stock market rallies, during downtrends, it saw a higher level of correlation.PlanB, a well-known Bitcoin investor, said:“S&P500 and Bitcoin have been correlated and co-integrated last 10 years.

237,"A new survey seems to debunk the common conception of Turkey as a cryptocurrency-savvy country. Major Turkish crypto exchange Paribu had a simple aim: to find 1,000 Turkish citizens who somehow heard about crypto. It took over 6,000 video interviews across 12 cities in Turkey during the peak of COVID-19 outbreak, to achieve this goal. The reported results have debunked a major myth about the Turkish crypto ecosystem. A previous report claiming that one-fifth of the Turkish population has used or owned cryptocurrency had drawn the attention of many global crypto players. The global-scale survey from Statista, conducted in the first half of 2019 across 18 countries via online polls with 1,000 respondents per country, had crowned Turkey as a global leader in crypto adoption. This staggering adoption rate was the highlight of numerous presentations made about Turkey and the region since the report first published. The new survey from Paribu, released on July 23, draws a sharp contrast with previous global reports by claiming that crypto usage among Turkish people is actually less than 1%. The survey itself was conducted by Akademetre Research Company on behalf of Paribu, and the results have been made public in the Cryptocurrency Awareness and Perception Survey report.The report highlights that out of 6,253 respondents only 44 traded cryptocurrency in some form. In other words, only 0.7% of Turks have ever bought or traded cryptocurrencies. On top of that, 97% of respondents have no idea that blockchain technology is used to issue and manage cryptocurrencies. Around 84% of respondents had never heard of cryptocurrency or Bitcoin (BTC).Those numbers triggered a second phase in the survey. Knowing that 44 is too small a sample size to conduct reliable research, Akademetre and Paribu then used another sampling. This time, they created another group of 300 regular crypto users.With the new sampling, the survey dug deep into the perception of Turkish crypto users. Out of those new batch of 300 respondents, 34% expressed their trust in crypto. It also found that people are searching for information about crypto through digital channels, with the internet (33.3%) and social media (17.7%) being the top-two choices. Crypto is used mostly as an investment or trading instrument, with less than one in three respondents using cryptocurrencies as a way to transfer money. Regardless of how it is used, crypto has a high satisfaction rate among the Turkish audience at 72.7%.The top choice of Turkish crypto users is Bitcoin with 68% dominance. Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) follow BTC from afar at 14.7% and 9.7%, respectively. Commenting on the results of the survey, Paribu CEO Yasin Oral highlights the low adoption rate of crypto in Turkey, adding:“There’s a huge potential audience in Turkey. As the young and tech-savvy population of the country sees the advantages of cryptocurrencies, user numbers are going to increase accordingly. The high satisfaction rate of current crypto users is a big implication for this.”BtcTurk, another major crypto exchange in Turkey, conducted a separate survey with the Istanbul University Statistics Appliances and Research Center to understand Bitcoin adoption in Turkey, Cointelegraph Turkey reported on July 23. It found that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, trust in Bitcoin increased by 23%, while satisfaction spiked 58.5%.Conducted with 379 respondents, the report states that crypto usage among the Turkish audience has doubled since February 2019."

This week, U.S. lenders received the green light from regulators to engage in cryptocurrency custody activities.Whether an influx from the sector would ultimately benefit Bitcoin as an asset remains a contentious topic. Previously, concerns circulated that institutional attention in the form of products such as a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) would be detrimental to price discovery.“It's not a matter of good or bad, it's just a fact,” Edwards added.Nonetheless, other recent moves only serve to reinforce the market’s upward trajectory.

239,"Garry Kasparov, the Russian chessmaster who faced off against IBM’s “Deep Blue” supercomputer, says Bitcoin, crypto and blockchain technologies, are the solution to the demand for privacy in financial markets.In a July 23 interview with Forbes contributor Roger Huang, Kasparov said he saw many upsides to cryptocurrencies. According to him, they give individuals more control over their money, which is usually regulated “either by the state, corporations or outside parties.”“The good thing about Bitcoin is that you know exactly the number — the magic number of 21 million,” the chessmaster said, referring to the maximum number of Bitcoin (BTC) tokens that will ever be mined. “But when you look at the other side, the Fed for instance, you never know how many trillions of dollars will appear on the market tomorrow that will damage your savings.”Kasparov is a chair of the Human Rights Foundation, a foundation which uses technology and digital innovations to protect those whose freedoms are threatened. According to him, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are “natural choices” for protection against infringements on privacy and human rights. “I think the steady rise in popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as a concept is inevitable, because it’s a response to the shift of power from individuals to states or other institutions that may act on our privacy without our consent.”Cointelegraph reported in June that a chess match between grandmaster Sergey Karjakin and Algorand founder Silivio Micali was recorded on the blockchain. Like Kasparov, Kajakin expressed an interest in cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology. Algorand, a proof of stake blockchain platform, may be used to further greater adoption of chess, according to Micali."
240,"Carlos Ghosn — the ex-Nissan head who made a dramatic escape from house arrest in Japan in December — paid the extraction team half a million dollars worth of crypto.According to U.S. prosecutors in a court filing, Ghosn’s son arranged for a payment to Peter Taylor — one of the two men who assisted the ex-Nissan chairman in fleeing Japan — of $500,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) through the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase. Taylor and his father, ex-Green Beret Michael Taylor, smuggled Ghosn out of Japan in a musical instrument case and assisted in his transport from Kansai International Airport in Osaka.Ghosn reportedly paid the Taylors $1.36 million in total for services related to his escape from Japan and relocation to Lebanon, where he has citizenship. The BTC payments were made in installments from January to May — after Ghosn’s dramatic escape on December 29. Japanese investigators said that Ghosn himself wired $860,000 to a company run by Peter Taylor as part of the initial payment.The Taylors have been in U.S. custody since their arrest in May at the request of the Japanese government. Ghosn is currently free in Lebanon, which does not have an extradition agreement with Japan.Ghosn was arrested and indicted four times in the Asian nation between 2018 and 2019 on charges related to financial crimes at Nissan, resulting in stints of detainment, solitary confinement, interrogations without a lawyer present, and eventual house arrest. His lawyer and others in the country labeled the treatment “hostage justice,” accusing Japanese authorities of forcing confessions through extended detainment.The ex-Nissan head had been under house arrest in Tokyo since April when the Taylors arrived under the guise of attending a violin concert. Ghosn was free to visit the nearby Grand Hyatt hotel, where he met the Taylors. He was then able to take public transportation from Tokyo to Osaka, where the larger musical instrument case — with Ghosn inside — was loaded onto a private jet bound for Istanbul before taking a second plane to Beirut.Ghosn’s case has similarities to that of Mark Karpeles’, the former CEO of defunct crypto exchange Mt Gox. Both men were subject to Japanese law for alleged financial crimes. Like Ghosn, Karpeles was familiar with the country’s justice system, having spent 11 months in detention himself since his arrest in August 2015. Prior to Ghosn’s escape, the two even spoke in person, a conversation that may have influenced his decision to flee Japan. However, Karpeles chose to face the system. He was eventually acquitted of major charges related to Mt. Gox but charged with mishandling electronic funds. His latest appeal over the final charge was denied in June."

This opinion clarifies that banks can continue satisfying their customers’ needs for safeguarding their most valuable assets, which today for tens of millions of Americans includes cryptocurrency.”Effectively, this has opened the floodgates for banks to enter the cryptocurrency market and provide their clients with tools to invest in cryptocurrencies.Throughout 2020, a consistent increase in institutional inflows into Bitcoin has continued to push the cryptocurrency market upwards.In the second quarter of this year, Grayscale said it processed $905.8 million in inflow to its cryptocurrency products. The firm, which operates the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, recorded $1.4 billion in total inflow over Q1-Q2.Bank-run crypto custodial solutions could be an alternative to existing regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles. Investors may be interpreting this new development as bullish as it means more accredited and institutional investors could potentially invest in the cryptocurrency market in the long-term.Peter Van Valkenburgh, the research director at non-profit organization CoinCenter, said:“Accepting that centralized entities for cryptocurrency safekeeping and storage are unavoidable and essential, then it is excellent news that, thanks to the OCC’s new policies, there will be even more competition for providing those services. National banks entering the game expands that competition and may also allow more traditional institutional investors to deal in cryptocurrencies.”It is possible that the unexpected announcement of the OCC fueled an abrupt increase in demand for top cryptocurrencies.The overall response to the statement of the OCC was positive. Industry executives generally said that it could result in more inflows into the cryptocurrency market in the medium-term.But, Compound Labs lawyer Jake Chervinsky emphasized that the OCC is one of many regulators in the U.S. It is also unclear whether Brooks will remain as the Acting Comptroller for a long period.Since banks move based on market demand, Chervinsky suggested that it does not guarantee an upsurge in banks supporting crypto custody. He said:“Banks are ultimately businesses like any other, so they'll respond to customer demand. But OCC is only one of many relevant regulators, Brian Brooks may not be in charge there for much longer, and banks are psychotically risk-averse / compliance-focused.”As such, it remains to be seen whether investors are merely using the news as a narrative to push up the market."
242,"The UK National Cyber Security Centre released a report on July 23 that discloses a growing trend in ransomware attacks against the sports sector. They noted a recent example in which attackers demanded that an English Football League club, or EFL, pay a multi-million dollar ransom in Bitcoin (BTC).According to the Cyber Threat to Sports Organizations paper, the unnamed club was targeted by ransomware that crippled their corporate security systems.The ransom amount requested was 400 BTC ($3.66 million). The club declined to pay, resulting in a loss of their stored data.The study reveals that the attack may have led to significant damages. It notes that the club was unable to use their corporate emails, and the stadium’s CCTV system and turnstiles were non-operational due to the attack.There is no public information on the attack vector that allowed the criminals to infiltrate their system. One hypothesis is that a phishing email was used to deploy the attack. The systems may also have been accessed through the CCTV system.The UK cybersecurity authorities disclosed that the attack cost the club “several hundred thousand pounds.”According to the study, approximately 40% of the attacks on British sports organizations involved malware and a quarter of this involved ransomware.These attacks have been growing in terms of impact since 2018, with cybercriminals mostly targeting high-value sports entities.Ransomware attacks worldwide increased by 200% in the same period of time. The software required to carry out such an attack is widely available on the darknet.Instances of so-called “crypto-jacking” — a ransomware method in which criminals commandeer devices to mine cryptocurrency — spiked in Singapore 300% year-on-year Q1 2020."
243,"For years, tribalism has plagued the blockchain industry. Developers align to specific consensus protocols and defend technologies that use them, regardless of their limitations. These deeply rooted divisions are slowing the innovation needed to scale blockchain for future adoption. The enterprise market is only beginning to understand the promise of blockchain, and that promise will be difficult to achieve until blockchains can communicate and cooperate with each other. To achieve this, developers, companies and hobbyists alike must be able to leverage every platform without being locked into one simply because the platform developers are not working together. Blockchain can bring transparency, security, new incentive models and ownership of data to the world at a time when these traits are desperately needed. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed how fragmented supply chains are and how difficult it can be to align the incentives of an industry so that it can act quickly in a crisis. As the World Economic Forum states:“This specific challenge is not only a technology problem, but also a problem in governance, data ownership and commercial business models in terms of how they incentivize ecosystem stakeholders to collaborate with each other.” This challenge is one that blockchain can help solve. When we need a consensus of governance and technology that is both transparent and auditable, we need blockchain.It has been 11 years since the publication of the Bitcoin white paper, and yet the blockchain industry was not ready when the world desperately needed us. Why? Artificial barriers such as platform lock-in and tribalism created needless friction, stifled the core of this movement, and left us flat-footed when blockchain solutions were called upon. One of the biggest lessons from 2020 is that the world needs us to work together — to rally behind solving an issue that is bigger than our silos. While some blockchain-based solutions have emerged to address the pandemic crisis, there hasn’t been a collective response. Not yet, anyway.The pandemic is not over, and there will be events in the future that show us other critical deficiencies in the systems the world depends on. The question is, will the different tribes be prepared to solve the big and important challenges, or will we stay in our niches, content to debate philosophical minutiae? If we want to realize blockchain as the big and important transformative technology it can be, we need to talk seriously about interoperability.Interoperability is the ability for multiple blockchains — with their various opinions on consensus models and resource governance — to communicate with each other. This means that a developer can input data on one chain and create some effect on another. When it comes to smart-contract blockchains, which are necessary to solve big complex problems, developers have a lot of choices: delegated proof-of-stake or proof-of-work, public or private, permissioned or permissionless, C++ or Solidity, etc. Options are generally a good thing, unless it’s difficult to understand how to make a good choice or if a bad choice may result in a very expensive misstep. Many of these options are artificially conflated and end up creating platform lock-in that is difficult to break.It does not need to be this way. Code should be code. Whether it is deployable on a platform is a negotiation between the platform and the developer. Essentially, if you’re familiar or comfortable with coding in Solidity or with the nuances of Ethereum smart contracts, you should not have to sacrifice your specific preferences to be a part of a different blockchain’s community. Embracing interoperability means empowering the developers that didn’t adopt your preferred platform, and Block.one is seeking to incentivize our community to do just that.We challenged our community, our developers, and our best and brightest to empower another platform’s developers. We incentivized our developers to learn the Ethereum Virtual Machine inside and out. As a result, public blockchains like Telos are beginning to offer drop-in support for Ethereum applications. This is a necessary, important first step. Ethereum developers can use the tools and languages they are familiar with: They can build the same EVM bytecode they would deploy to an Ethereum-powered blockchain and drop it into an EOSIO blockchain seamlessly. Their clients, using Web 3.0, can simply shift to a different set of API providers as if it was another Ethereum-based blockchain. To be clear, the ability for Ethereum developers to leverage the benefits of EOSIO is only a single example.Blockchain seems to be engaged in a space race. Developer communities are competing to see which can garner the highest number of applications running on their platform, which can process the highest number of transactions per second, and which blockchain can position itself as a viable service offering for enterprise and government customers. Imagine what could be achieved if the key players pooled their resources to cooperatively solve global problems, such as transforming an aging supply chain during a pandemic. Block.one, Telos, Binance, Ethereum and several others have taken the important first steps, but we need to see everyone in the industry rally behind these solutions.Blockchain is still evolving. We have not yet achieved a global application that leverages multiple different blockchain technologies and benefits from each one’s strengths in concert. It’s vital for the leading platforms and talented developers to work together to implement solutions that make accessing blockchain easier for newcomers in order to enable the industry to achieve its fullest potential.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Bart Wyatt is the director of solutions architecture at Block.one.

244,"Over the years, it has become a known fact for anyone dealing with cryptocurrencies that scams are running rampant. However, as more novice players enter the market, more scammers up their tactics to take advantage of unsuspecting Bitcoin enthusiasts with fake Bitcoin giveaways and other elaborate schemes. Recently, a new bout of scammers has emerged with even more sophisticated and aggressive tactics. As evident through most reports, the scammers are taking advantage of popular social media platforms like YouTube and Twitter to capture their victims. For instance, on July 13 Charles Hoskinson who is the founder of Cardano warned about a YouTube account that has been promoting fake giveaways of Cardano (ADA).Most recently a sizable attack targeting high profile twitter accounts has exposed the inherent security risks on major social media platforms. As Cointelegraph reported, potentially thousands of people got scammed out of their Bitcoin after several prominent and verified twitter accounts were hacked to promote a fake Bitcoin giveaway. The scammers managed to reach an estimated 350 million people making away with about $110,000 in a matter of hours.In almost every twitter account belonging to a prominent individual, the audience was encouraged to send $1,000 in Bitcoin to a specified address to receive $2,000 as a free giveaway.Apart from Twitter, YouTube has also proven itself to be one of the  favorite tools for scammers. According to a report published on July 10 by Whale Alert, one scam project that operated in June 2020, made away with more than $120,000 in a day by using a single-page website and YouTube advertising to lure unsuspecting victims. Cardano’s CEO, Charles Hoskinson warned against scams promoting fake Cardano giveaways on YouTube. In a tweet, the founder of Cardano said that “a scam has been floating around using my conference keynote to promote a giveaway,” he added: “This is a scam. Please report it to YouTube. We will take legal action if we can against those responsible.” Although YouTube has since deleted the video, Hoskinson retweeted that there were still YouTube adverts promoting the scams.Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also been targeted by impersonators who hack and rename YouTube channels as “XRP Giveaways” eventually fleecing millions from unwitting XRP holders. In response, Ripple has filed a lawsuit against YouTube for allegedly profiting from the actions of the scammers while having the ability to stop them.In another case of scams on YouTube, a number of victims were lured into a pyramid scheme in early June after promises of a possible 200% payback for their bitcoin donation to a YouTube account named “SpaceX.”According to reports, the scammer managed to get away with 15.3 BTC. Bleeping Computer reports that the scammers operate by hacking existing youtube channels, changing their channel name to SpaceX and publishing archived footage of Elon Musk (or any other public figure) to make it look like Musk’s archived speeches are live.While the legitimate SpaceX channel has over 4 million subscribers, two of the channels hijacked by the scammers had 130,000 subscribers and 230,000 subscribers thereby giving the viewers the appearance of a legitimate following. Each of the fake SpaceX channels asked its viewers to send bitcoin to a specified address. To further promote the fake youtube live streams to a wider audience the scammers used bots to scale up the number of viewers on the live streams thus giving an impression to the YouTube algorithm of a viral video. With a combination of socially engineered tricks and boosted viewership from bots, the scammers managed to get their videos on top of youtube searches especially for keywords related to prominent individuals like Jack Ma and Elon Musk. Even though YouTube has since responded by taking down hacked channels that promoted the scams.Whale Alert reports that giveaway scams find it easy to use the identities of celebrities to lure large audiences with the help of tools such as YouTube advertising. An affiliated service Scam Alert has reported that since the start of the year, the outfit reports that more than 20 million in Bitcoin has been stolen.As it seems, scammers are using increasingly aggressive tactics in the form of fake companies with dozens of websites and fake social media accounts to promote their schemes. Dominik Scheiner, the co-founder of the IOTA foundation told Cointelegraph: ""These Crypto Scams on social media have become a lot more sophisticated and aggressive over the last few months. The fact that they are continuing, clearly shows that these scams are working.”True to Schiener’s concerns, Whale Alert reports that prominent Giveaway scams that feature celebrities like Elon Musk as well popular exchanges can net upwards of $300,000 US dollars. As scammers increasingly change their methods by using professional teams to increase the quality of their attacks, experts warn that it is just a matter of time before ‘deep fake’ techniques are introduced to the scam market.Last year, Jack Dorsey’s account was hacked amid assurances from Twitter that the flaw was fixed. The recent bout of attacks, however, reveals that there are still many vulnerabilities on the platform. As to the reason why Twitter and YouTube are attractive tools for scammers, Schiener believes it’s due to their popularity:“A comment on a popular tweet or YouTube video might be seen by thousands of people, making it easier to succeed with these scams. Also, nearly all social media platforms today lack better moderation tools and policies.”According to Schiener popular social media platforms cannot get rid of fake or harmful content and unless these platforms implement “better content moderation tools, these scams will only increase and further evolve.”With the U.S. presidential elections fast approaching, tight security measures on all major social media platforms are needed more than ever. Schiener mentioned that the recent bout of scams showcased that digital identities with verifiable credentials based on a distributed chain are a real way to fight back. With a DLT identity and verification system, Schiener explains that it is impossible to “impersonate another person’s identity or fake a credential” as the data is immutable and verifiable using KYC systems.The notion of self-sovereign identity and verification systems are designed to give the user control over their information. Self-sovereign identity offers a solution to standard identity verification systems that cluster a user’s information on central servers creating massive vulnerabilities. However, by placing self-sovereign identity and verification systems on a DLT, centralized, external and third-party control is removed thereby reducing the risk of widespread data breaches. Despite the optimism around the transformative potential of DLT based identity verification systems, experts reveal that less than 10% of apps are expected to take on DLT solutions by 2023. Even though there are existing solutions and the sector has an estimated yearly growth of 35%, adoption is still slow. Some of the immediate solutions that social media platforms such as Youtube can adopt for now include, training its users on the platforms security risks. Also, YouTube can continuously monitor accounts on its platform to identify and stop any suspicious activity.The recent bout of hacks on YouTube has obviously eroded the trust of its users on the platform's security. However, beyond the loss of trust, YouTube will likely face legal consequences given that the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires companies of its caliber to have top-notch security levels. In the past, other social media sites such as Facebook have also been called to attention to tighten their security and community management tools.Already, YouTube is facing a lawsuit from Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company’s attorneys for its failure to stop scammers and impersonators while benefiting from adverts that promote scams. So far, YouTube has responded that it is not liable for crypto scams perpetrated by third parties.As the crypto scam market grows, its impact on people’s lives is increasingly becoming substantial. For most crypto and blockchain enthusiasts, scams have been their first introduction to the industry as the unregulated nature of the sector leaves room for scammers to go about unchecked.Schiener suggests that the pandemic might have had a hand in giving rise to cybercrime in general as lockdowns around the world left many people out of work: “This meant that they had to work from less secure work environments and generally spend more time online. This gave scammers an obvious opportunity to increase their efforts.”Additionally, Schiener opines that the rise in crypto scams could also be a signal indicating a rise in retail investors joining the crypto sphere. He adds, “Since many of these new investors are more novice, it’s much easier to trick them into a giveaway or more elaborate phishing schemes."""
245,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged from $9,160 to $9,584 within the last 48 hours. But despite the 4.6% gain, some traders are turning short-term bearish on the top cryptocurrency.According to several technical analysts, the market structure of Bitcoin remains slightly bearish. At higher time frames, $9,500 could still technically be a lower high. The term “lower high” is used when the recent peak of BTC is lower than previous highs.The daily chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comOn June 3, June 10, June 22, and July 22, BTC hit $10,473, $10,180, $9,794 and $9,584, respectively. Each peak is lower than previous highs, making it a lower high formation.Some traders are bearish on Bitcoin for two major reasons, namely a lower high structure and declining volume. Crypto trader Zoran Kole, for example, said that a bearish market structure at a higher time frame remains intact. On the daily chart, four consecutive lower highs indicate a potentially weak consolidation phase. He wrote:“HTF Bearish MS remains intact. One shouldn't use a potential LH as invalidation for a swing position unless that LH is confirmed with a LL. Patiently waiting for the 95xx sweep to compound. Looking to sell 9530-9580. Clear invalidation above 97/98 (break in MS).”A potential lower high at a higher time frame for Bitcoin. Source: Zoran KoleMeanwhile, a pseudonymous trader known as Crypto ISO suggested that the market could see a pullback if BTC hit a lower high. For it to confirm, BTC would have to break down from $9,500. The trader said:“Would be tough for a lot of people if this is the lower high. Those that understand MS will get this.”Pseudonymous trader DonAlt said that for a short-term bearish trend to confirm, BTC ideally needs to drop below $9,300. If BTC stays above $9,500, the popular trader said short-term market bias could weaken.He said:“Close above that red line today ($9300) and I might reconsider my short term bearish bias (mid-term bear bias remains). Close below and I'll consider shorting more aggressively targeting the green line ($8500) first and green area second (~$7000).”Apart from technicals and market structures, there are more fundamental factors supporting a bullish case for Bitcoin.For instance, the hash rate of BTC remains resilient, leaving the mining ecosystem healthy. Lower selling pressure from miners, combined with declining exchange inflows, suggests BTC could see an uptrend.Data from Binance Futures show that the majority of “top” traders on the platform remain majority long on Bitcoin. But over 50% of traders are short on large-market cap alternative cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH) and XRP.Raoul Pal, the CEO of Global Macro Investor, said on July 23 that Bitcoin could outperform gold, which has been on a strong rally in recent weeks. He stated:“The other bet is that bitcoin will likely beat gold too. The bitcoin/gold cross looks powerful but has yet to break out.”Whether the short-term bearish market structure could cause a near-term pullback, or bullish fundamental factors would offset the risk, remains to be seen."
246,"Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies will not get their big break thanks to the problems with the fiat economy, says veteran trader Peter Brandt.In a series of tweets on July 22, the popular commentator forecast that in future, the world will resort to so-called special drawing rights (SDRs) based on multiple fiat currencies.Similarly, a return to the gold standard will not occur, Brandt claimed, while the SDR setup would likewise not include Bitcoin or altcoins.SDRs were created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the late 1960s as an extension to member states’ reserves. At present, the equivalent of around $281 billion have been issued, according to the IMF’s latest official data.According to Brandt, the future SDR basket would consist of seven major fiat currencies, along with precious metals and oil.“Prediction: World will NOT return to Gold standard,” he wrote. “World could adopt a formulaic ‘SDR’ global reserve unit consisting of USD, JPY, CNH, EUR, CAD, AUD, GBP, Gold, Silver, Crude Oil. Bitcoin $BTC or other cryptos will NOT be part of basket.”Gold continues to shoot for higher highs after lingering at its best levels since 2011. Silver is also at multi-year highs.Bitcoin proponents frequently argue that the demise of the gold standard directly sparked the problems now ubiquitous within the fiat system. By allowing central banks to control the money supply, their own interests would ultimately take precedent, Saifedean Ammous writes in the popular book, “The Bitcoin Standard.”Brandt, however, cast suspicion on those who see Bitcoin as the solution which is destined to usurp fiat altogether.“Eventually entire monetary system will evolve past paper fiat. But over the near-term (10 to 20 years) the only way out of debt for govts is to deflate USD,” he continued. “I just object to the arrogance of the crypto crowd to assume its pet rocks will replace all fiats.”His words come as the United States prepares to release trillions of dollars in fresh stimulus, further adding to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. BTC/USD appeared buoyed by the news, climbing to highs of $9,550 overnight on Wednesday."
247,"In April, the Japanese government began distributing 100,000 yen payments — about $930 —  to every household. But did the Japanese follow some in the United States and spend that money in crypto exchanges? The data from the three major crypto exchanges in Japan suggests they probably did not. In his latest report, Yuya Hasegawa, a market analyst at Bitbank exchange notes some “irregularities” in the month of June in terms of deposits but overall concludes that the coronavirus relief payments did not result in significant changes to the behavior of Japanese crypto investors. There were some changes to normal. The number of 100K yen deposits from investors in their 40s was up more than 36%, surpassing that from investors in their 20s for the first time in two months. The number of 100K yen deposits from investors in their 50s increased by more than 35%. But according to Hasegawa, those changes are “too minuscule to alter overall investor behavior in any significant way”. By comparing the number of deposits in June with “previous months that recorded roughly the same amount of monthly BTC volume in the past (ie. Sep 19〜Dec 19”, he observed:  “The number of deposits and the degree of increase is a little too small to conclude, with confidence, that a number of Japanese investors are using their stimulus checks to buy crypto (emphasis on ‘a number of’)” Cointelegraph asked exchanges BitFlyer and Coincheck to check the number of 100K yen deposits since April. By and large the results confirmed the Covid-19 stimulus payment had little impact on crypto purchasesBitFlyer compared the month of February with April, May, and June. The number of 100K yen deposits increased from 1.1 to 1.2 times from April to June. The rate of increase was small and BitFlyer said it couldn’t conclude if the number was buoyed by the coronavirus rescue stimulus. According to Coincheck, the number of 100K yen deposits gradually increased between January to April but stopped increasing in May. It decreased in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. Why did Japanese investors shy away from using the relief money for crypto investments? Hasegawa suggested it could be related to the “Japanese consumer’s tendential characteristic towards investment”: “In Japan, average households allocate only about 15% of their funds to financial products (excluding insurance, pension, and standardized guarantee scheme) and a little over 50% to savings, whereas the average US and EU households allocate more to financial products and less to their savings.”As Cointelegraph reported, on July 13th, the Bank of Japan revealed that the supply of M3 in the country — essentially the volume of deposits by individuals, corporations, and local governments excluding financial institutions— increased 5.9% in June to $13.5 trillion."
248,"Within the last hour Bitcoin (BTC) price broke out of its sideways range to briefly push above the $9,500 level. The move comes after a slight uptick in daily trading volume since Monday (July 20) and traders will now watch to see if the top-ranked digital asset on CoinMarketCap can hold $9,500 and pursue a daily higher high above $9,775. Perhaps the move is purely technical as Bitcoin price has been compressing into a tighter range of higher lows and lower highs since early June, or possibly investor sentiment has been buoyed by recent events in the news. Crypto market weekly price chart. Source: Coin360Earlier today Cointelegraph reported that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has given permission to allow federally chartered U.S. banks to provide clients with crypto custody services. This is a positive step forward as it removes some of the rigamarole involved in acquiring and storing cryptocurrency, meaning, crypto investors will eventually be able to hold their digital assets in the same bank where they keep their checking, savings, and brokerage accounts. The recent announcement from the European Union to kickstart another $857 billion euro round of stimulus and the expectation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will follow suit with a $1 to $2 trillion economic stimulus package could also be boosting investors’ belief that as long as the Fed is printing, equities will rise and Bitcoin will soon make another run at $10,000. In regards to the new rounds of stimulus Gemini exchange co-founder and CEO Tyler Winklevoss suggested that: “The Fed continues to set the stage for Bitcoin’s bull run.”In traditional markets, silver started off the week with a strong pump which completed a nice cup and handle pattern on the daily timeframe, and at the time of writing the asset is up 19.25% for the week. Gold has also continued its upward trajectory by pushing to a new high at $1,874 today. To date, gold has gained 29% since the coronavirus-driven market correction occurred in mid-March. The S&P 500 and Dow also continue to push a bit higher each day, further proof that investors expect that the Federal Reserve and central banks across the world will continue to roll out stimulus. As mentioned earlier, expansionary monetary policies are clearly boosting investor confidence in the markets regardless of whatever weaknesses analysts might spot in the economy. Remember, as the age-old saying dictates: The stock market is not the economy. Bitcoin daily price chart. Source: Coin360Now that Bitcoin price has managed to close the day above $9,500 investors will watch to see if a higher high above $9,775 can be achieved, after which a shot at the $9,900-$10,000 level comes into play.  Altcoins also posted moderate gains as the Bitcoin price pushed higher at the start of this week. Ether (ETH) rallied by nearly 12%, XRP gained 2.88%, and Litecoin (LTC) added 2.86%.   According to CoinMarketCap, the overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $284.7 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61.7%."
249,"U.S. government spending may lead to upward Bitcoin (BTC) prices, according to Gemini crypto exchange co-founder and CEO, Tyler Winklevoss. ""The Fed continues to set the stage for bitcoin's next bull run,"" Winklevoss said in a July 22 tweet, which included an article link on the government agency's discussions of further stimulus spending.  As a decentralized borderless digital asset away from government control, Bitcoin holds as a potential hedge to mainstream markets and national dollars — a point often stressed by a number of crypto industry participants. Bitcoin holds a 21 million coin maximum supply, protecting the asset against value dilution. ""When money printer go brrrr and inflate the stonks market, it’s time to Bitcoin,"" Winkelvoss said in a July 18 tweet, referring to U.S. money printing resulting in a rising stock market, while giving the nod to Bitcoin as an alternative.Since March, the U.S. government has beefed up its monetary activity, attempting to prop up a struggling economy — the result of to COVID-19 preventions measures. Such efforts have included a $2 trillion stimulus package, which, in part, dished out essentially free money to U.S. citizens, depending on income levels. With current stimulus money reaching its end soon, the government must assess the situation, possibly issuing further relief capital, as mentioned by Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano in a recent YouTube livestream. The financial expert mentioned U.S. dollar inflation over the last several decades, noting the importance of exiting cash into various assets, including Bitcoin."
250,"Recently the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC) premium to net asset value (NAV) reached its lowest level since November 2018. This premium shows that traders are paying more for GBTC shares than the underlying Bitcoin (BTC) quantity held by the fund.This difference is caused mostly due to retail investors inability to purchase shares directly from Grayscale Investments, whose funds are aimed exclusively for accredited investors.Currently, GBTC is the largest cryptocurrency listed investment fund with $3.5 billion assets under management, totaling over 386,000 BTC under custody. Therefore, it is considered a relevant indicator of investors appetite.The recent decreases in this premium raised some eyebrows amongst analysts and crypto pundits who claimed it might signal the beginning of a significant move, as per previous similar moments.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) premium to net assets. Source: YChartsOver the past two years, there have been four instances where the GBTC premium marked a local bottom and bounced back up. As shown above, upticks in the premium marked short-term bull moments in three out of four occurrences.The only exception was the notorious November 2018 crash that occurred after Bitcoin lost its longtime $6,000 support. Given the decreasing premium, investors will now question if the ‘signal’ could be predicting a similar movement. July 16 marked the lowest levels in twenty months, and now the premium seems to be bouncing back to 9%.To correctly assess whether the current moment resembles the past negative outcome, one needs to analyze investor sentiment back then. One of the best metrics trading wise is the futures premium (contango) and market volume.Contango measures longer-term futures contracts premium and provides a reliable indicator to investors’ expectations. There’s usually a 0.5% to 1.5% premium on 3-month contracts in healthy markets, indicating a normal contango. When this indicator goes negative, known as backwardation, it is a signal of bearishness.OKEx 3-month BTC futures premium. Source: TradingViewThe 3-month futures contract premium stands at a modest 1% to the current Bitcoin price, similar to the level found in November 2018. Although not a bearish level, such contango does not show any excessive optimism from professional traders.Volume is unarguably the most relevant metric investors track. Although there can be an infinite number of reasons for increased investor interest, there’s nothing positive to be gleaned from dwindling trading activity. To better assess such metrics, one should also look at futures contracts. While conflicting trends are not common, they could explain any volume changes in the underlying asset.20-day average BTC volumes in 2018. Source: TradingViewVolume in derivatives, fiat, and USDT-based exchanges were in a steep reduction in the November 2018 crash. As shown in the chart below, the same set of worrisome indicators exist.20-day average BTC volumes. Source: TradingViewIn addition to the GBTC premium, contango, and volume, traders should also investigate the traders’ sentiment during the most recent occasions when the premium bottomed. OKEx 3-month BTC futures premium. Source: TradingViewThe 3-month upfront contract premium shows three drastically different scenarios, marked by excessive optimism in January 2020 at 2%, and bearish sentiment in April 2020 at -1%.BTC futures trading below the spot price is a typical signal of discomfort from professional investors and this scenario is referred to as backwardation.October 2019 was the only instance resembling November 2018 and the current level at a rather neutral 1% premium. To gain further insight into this, one should check volume trends to understand if previous GBTC low premium instances correlate to the present moment.20-day average BTC volumes. Source: TradingViewThe only instance showing a downtrend in volume seems to be April 20. However, the volume spike was caused by the market activity on March 13 when Bitcoin faced a 20% crash in a single hour. The figures from April 20 can’t be deemed low compared to the previous couple of months.Three indicators are currently mirroring the pre-November 2018 crash: decreasing volume, a rather neutral 1% 3-months futures premium, and the GBTC premium bouncing from lows. The thing to remember is history doesn’t repeat itself, but it tends to rhyme. There is no such thing as an unfailing indicator, even if many point in the same direction. Investors get nervous each time Bitcoin tests its $9,000 support, and they have many reasons for that.

251,"A survey conducted by pioneering digital music store eMusic revealed that most of their service’s users were open to paying with crypto if it allowed artists to earn more.The survey — shared exclusively with Cointelegraph — revealed that 65% of eMusic customers would use cryptocurrency if it was for the aforementioned reasons. It is worth noting that a mere 8% of the respondents had used Bitcoin (BTC) or any other crypto in the past.Per the announcement, 800 eMusic users answered questions about cryptocurrencies and their use in the music industry.Survey data revealed that 40% of music listeners overestimate the amount of royalties that artists receive when their music is purchased or streamed. 87% believed that a “fair share” for the artists would be a higher sum, with the most popular response being a 50% split.The report released in May by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry showed that music streaming boosted music revenues to over $20 billion in 2019. Still, an analysis by the music news website, Soundcharts, estimates that artists are paid only $0.00318 per stream on Spotify.As Cointelegraph reported at the end of May, eMusic is building a decentralized music distribution system to reduce the cost of inefficiencies and pay artists more when fans purchase and stream their music.EMusic, which launched in 1998, is known for being one of the first websites to sell DRM-free MP3 music recordings. Company data website Owler reveals that the firm employs 278 people and has an annual revenue of $65.7 million.The idea of making music fairer using cryptocurrencies is not new. Independent tech marketing and PR consultant Eric Doyle told Cointelegraph last year that there are in fact many projects trying to apply blockchain technology to the music industry.The author of this story contributed some of the questions used in eMusic’s survey."

Philip Lowe, the governor of the Australian Reserve Bank, has warned against the consequences of unlimited monetary expansion. Lowe said that “there is no free lunch,” and somebody always has to pay for the money printing “in one form or the other.”The European Union has also agreed on a massive recovery fund of about $857 billion to buoy the social and economic crisis caused due to the coronavirus pandemic.

253,"A K-drama series titled “Romantic Hacker” is set to air online in October across South Korea. It focuses on crypto and blockchain-related topics and is linked to a romance story. The show is slated to film in August.According to Sports Donga, K-pop star Kwon Hyun-bin will be featured in the series as the male lead, “Jaemin.”The story follows the hack of a crypto trading platform called “Jeju International Crypto Exchange.” Jaemin will fight a gang of highly skilled hackers that attempt to steal the money from the exchange.Although the talent agency in charge of hiring actors and actresses for the series stated that it will be “an action-comedy” story based on cryptocurrency, media outlets believe that the story could have a romantic touch due to the K-drama’s title.Romantic Hacker is the first crypto-themed K-drama series to be aired in South Korea. By hiring Kwon, it is believed that the show hopes to attract a massive young fanbase.K-pop star is also well known for being a model and an actor. His filmography indicates he has starred in three TV series, including Netflix’s “Part-Time Idol,” and most recently in JTBC’s “Don’t Let Go of Your Mind.”Cointelegraph reported about a crypto-related manga, Genesis Code, which was created to combat the content creation crisis in Japan.According to a synopsis published by the series’ official website, the story revolves around the mystery of Bitcoin’s creation. It is set in 2009; the year Bitcoin (BTC) was invented."
254,"Bitcoin (BTC) has made global headlines again because of the recent Twitter hack, but this time, we need to work harder to protect Bitcoin’s integrity and the progress the industry has made.The coordinated social engineering attack compromised the Twitter accounts of high-profile figures and organizations like Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tesla founder Elon Musk, Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, former United States President Barack Obama and 2020 U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden, among many others, to ask for Bitcoin in fake “giveaway” posts.When the story broke, the New York Times, BBC and other mainstream media outlets were quick to label the incident a “Bitcoin scam” or “crypto scam.”To have “Bitcoin” and “scam” used in the same breath in the global media may feel like all the work that’s gone into building trust for this revolutionary technology since its creation in 2009 has been for nothing.This is even more reason why companies and their communication teams must turn the publicity Bitcoin is getting now into a positive for the industry.The first point to clarify with the media, friends, family and newcomers is that this is a high-profile Twitter hack.This is not a “Bitcoin hack,” not a “Bitcoin Twitter hack” nor even a “Twitter Bitcoin hack” — as described by The Evening Standard and even Wired — because Bitcoin did not get hacked, nor did Bitcoin cause the hack.It’s even more concerning to see The Late Show with Stephen Colbert describe the hackers as “Bitcoin Bandits,” when the motives of the hackers have not been confirmed.Twitter is a centralized organization; it holds all users’ data and accounts in one place. For the hackers to gain access to this many Twitter accounts, they would have to break into Twitter’s centralized database.Let’s spell it out clearly: Hackers broke into Twitter’s database and compromised high-profile accounts to ask for Bitcoin.A CNN Business report did the story justice by saying the scam itself was fairly common and Bitcoin was just “the currency used to quickly cash in on the hack.”Related: Twitter Wouldn’t Be Hacked If It Were Backed by Blockchain TechnologyThis hack raises concerns about the vulnerability of centralized organizations that hold our data and strengthens the case for Bitcoin’s decentralized peer-to-peer network.Within a few hours of the initial fake “giveaway” tweets, the hacker’s Bitcoin address received approximately $120,000 worth of Bitcoin in 375 transactions. To put it into context, $120,000 is a minor loss in comparison to the notorious cryptocurrency hacks that the industry has seen, such as the $40 million that was stolen, from the centralized cryptocurrency exchange Binance back in May 2019.We must also make clear that the unlucky crypto holders who lost their funds, unfortunately, were duped by the fake giveaway post rather than had their funds “stolen.”While Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, this is the best opportunity for newcomers to learn about the benefits of Bitcoin’s traceability because the Bitcoin that was ultimately voluntarily sent to the hackers can easily be tracked on a blockchain explorer.Not long after the hack was discovered, Twitter restricted the ability for people to tweet crypto addresses. The crypto community can also argue that this did not make a big difference to the safety of user funds because it is harder to steal from a crypto account (unless you have its private key), whereas sharing your bank account details publicly might get you into serious trouble.This is a serious breach of Twitter’s centralized database, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched an investigation over national security concerns.It just so happens, however, that Bitcoin was the currency the hackers were demanding this time.

255,"Bitcoin (BTC) is at its least popular among Google users since last year — should history repeat itself, BTC/USD will reclaim $10,000.According to data from Google Trends, worldwide interest in the term “Bitcoin” is now at its lowest since December 2019.Over the past seven months, price volatility has delivered occasional spurts of curiosity in Bitcoin, but these have simply punctuated a general downtrend.As of July 20, interest was firmly at multi-month lows on Google’s normalized scale of 1 to 100 — at 45, “Bitcoin” was challenging its reading of 41 from the week of December 29.What occurred after the previous floor is conspicuous. After languishing at around $7,200 over the new year, BTC/USD began a swift ascent to highs of over $10,300.That price spike caused a modest uptick in search interest to 62, but it was the March coronavirus crash which formed the standout event among Google searches. May’s block subsidy halving produced similar effects.12-month Google search interest in “Bitcoin.” Source: Google TrendsGoogle thus joins an increasing number of indicators suggesting that Bitcoin price volatility is incoming. As Cointelegraph reported this week, low volume is also contributing to the sense that current conditions cannot last much longer.Realized volatility hit three-year lows on both the ten-day and thirty-day timespans this month.“The $9,200 resistance broke earlier today, which immediately led to a surge to the $9,400 resistance zone,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted in analysis on Tuesday.He added that for a real surge to occur, however, resistance levels higher up would need to be conquered first, these lying above $10,000 which BTC/USD could nonetheless soon break."
256,"Cryptocurrencies may render some outdated regulations obsolete, according to crypto-anarchist and white hat hacker Pavol Luptak.According to Luptak, “cryptocurrencies or crypto markets may undermine government laws and regulations that are obsolete for the 21st digital century.” He said, “I can say the Space Age technology will help us to escape from the Bronze Age rulership. Despite the fact that rulers will not like it.”“Although we spend a significant part of our lives in an unlimited borderless virtual online world, we are still trying to enforce the territorial laws valid for the physical world. I don't think it makes sense from a longer perspective,” he stated.Luptak also explained that nowadays anyone can create an anonymous offshore firm in any jurisdiction and use anonymous crypto assets instead of bank accounts, so traditional banking regulations are no longer enforceable.Because of this, he believes that “cryptocurrencies will provide a new haven” and “we can expect massive tax optimizations” as a result of the new fiscal competition. In fact, he believes that taxation itself is in danger:“When a lot of people or companies start to use truly anonymous cryptocurrencies, enforcement of taxation will also be challenging, maybe even impossible.”Luptak noted that when people use decentralized versions of services like Uber or Airbnb with anonymous cryptocurrency transactions, enforcing the same regulations that are applied to their centralized counterparts may be impossible. Generally, he expects that a universal sharing economy mobile application bypassing government control or taxation will also take off in the future. Such solutions couldn’t be taken down by authorities:“It can be a fully decentralized solution impossible to shut down by the government with the use of anonymous cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications, or even backed by decentralized legal subjects.”Because of those censorship-resistant services, Luptak believes that states can lose their business license monopoly.Luptak even claims that decentralized dispute resolution solutions are capable of replacing a significant portion of the functions traditionally performed by governments. Laws concerning data management like the right to be forgotten guaranteed by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation cannot be applied to blockchain technology.With the reduced ability for governments to spy on and censor communications, Luptak also expects that services like “anti-government insurance against victimless crimes”  or “anonymous, decentralized crowdfunded whistleblowing” to be born, with far-reaching consequences:“[Those technologies] can mean a total decomposition of all government secret agencies and government ‘classified’ agencies.”Luptak admits that he does not know whether such extreme decentralization will result in a positive or negative change, and says that it will probably be a combination of both. Still, he is convinced that — as with most technologies — the consequences of decentralization will depend of the needs of who uses the new tools:“I believe the future will reflect our needs satisfied with future technology. They may be, of course, perverse, creating new threats. But this is happening all the time during any technological evolution.”"
257,"Russia passed a major bill today related to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).The State Duma — Russia’s legislative body — has passed a bill titled “On Digital Financial Assets” in its final third reading, local news agency Regnum reports July 22.After initiating the bill back in 2018, Russian authorities have finally agreed to provide a legal status to cryptocurrencies, preparing to adopt the first major part of legislation for the industry. Following the latest Duma’s decision, the bill “On Digital Financial Assets,” or DFA, is expected to be officially adopted in Russia on Jan. 1, 2021. The bill provides a legal definition to digital assets and legitimizes cryptocurrency trading in Russia. However, the bill prohibits the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a payment method.While the DFA bill provides the foundation for Russia’s cryptocurrency legislation, the regulation of the industry will mainly be a part of a different bill. The latest report confirms the fact that the actual regulatory framework for crypto will be set out in the bill “On Digital Currency,” or DA. As reported, the Duma expects to pass the DA bill during the autumn session, which ends in late December.Some industry players are confident that the latest DFA bill should not be treated as the actual green light to crypto. Maria Stankevich, head of business development at crypto exchange EXMO, reportedly said that the DFA bill should be regarded as a “glossary” to crypto, while the DA bill is still being discussed by various Russian authorities and may eventually “come as a surprise.”Anatoly Aksakov, a member of the State Duma and a major figure behind Russia’s crypto legislation, reportedly said that the new law will allow local firms to issue stablecoins — a “stable” type of cryptocurrency that is often pegged to fiat currencies like USD.According to the official, Russians will be able to launch such coins as well as exchange them for other assets including digital assets that were issued abroad.As part of the new legislation, Russia’s central bank, the Bank of Russia, will reportedly become officially authorized to oversee the activity involving issuance of digital currencies in the country. Additionally, the bank will reportedly be able to impose additional requirements to crypto issuers as well as cryptocurrency exchanges. Russia’s central bank will also be in charge of providing a framework on what types of digital currencies can be purchased by qualified and unqualified investors."
258,"According to Ki Young-Ju, the CEO of market research firm CryptoQuant, three key on-chain indicators are currently signaling a Bitcoin (BTC) price uptrend. Metrics that hint at a bull market are less selling pressure from miners, low exchange inflows and declining exchange reserves.On July 20 Ki noted:“On-chain Indicators Status: BUY. Miners are not selling (based on MPI, Miner Outflows. No significant BTC exchange inflows from whales so far. All exchanges' reserves hit the year-low a month ago and keep that low.”The weekly price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comData from ByteTree shows miners have sold slightly more than what they mined in the last 12 weeks. In the past three months, miners produced 7,293 BTC and sold 7,365 BTC. A net inventory of -72 BTC is considered low selling pressure from miners, especially over a prolonged period.Miners sold slightly more than what they mined in the last 12 weeks. Source: ByteTreeThere are two possible reasons behind the lack of appetite among miners to sell Bitcoin in recent months. First, the hash rate of Bitcoin is near its all-time high. It means the mining sector is continuing to aggressively mine BTC despite the halving.Second, it suggests that the cost of mining is relatively low. When a record high difficulty adjustment occurs, the cost to mine BTC substantially increases. The resilience of the hash rate shows that Bitcoin miners are still quite profitable.When miners do not sell large amounts of Bitcoin over an extended period, it applies less selling pressure on BTC. Miners are one of the two major external sources of selling pressure in the crypto market along with exchanges.Low exchange inflows typically suggest that there are fewer investors or traders selling cryptocurrencies in the market. Conversely, exchange outflows indicate that more investors are moving Bitcoin to personal wallets.In June, Ki explained that a reasonable period to invest in Bitcoin is when whales send funds out of exchanges. That shows whales are predicting a prolonged rally in the near-term. He said:“Buy BTC when whales send bitcoins out of the exchange. The bull market usually starts four months after the exchange average withdrawal hits year-high.”Since March, inflows into Bitcoin spot exchanges have noticeably dropped. Data from CryptoQuant shows inflows are hovering in between 3,700 BTC and 17,000 BTC. In May, inflows were ranging between 6,800 BTC and 38,000 BTC.Inflows into Bitcoin spot exchanges have steadily dropped since March. Source: CryptoQuantMeanwhile, Bitcoin exchange reserves have dropped substantially since mid-April. In the last three months, exchange reserves declined from 2.56 million to 2.44 million.Although a 4% drop in exchange reserves could seem minor, exchange reserves never dropped to the low-2 million levels for well over a year.Bitcoin exchange reserves drop to 2.44 million BTC. Source: CryptoQuantA confluence of low selling pressure from miners, declining exchange reserves, and low inflows could indicate the start of an accumulation phase.

259,"Cryptocurrency public blockchains will settle more in 2020 than ever before and have already topped $1.3 trillion, data shows.Compiled by analytics firm Messari on July 21, the figures reveal that Bitcoin (BTC) has settled $712 billion so far this year, while Ether (ETH) is on $147 billion.The Ethereum network, which supports stablecoins including market cap leader Tether (USDT), has added another $423 billion to the total. Growth in combined stablecoin transaction value is conspicuous, with the first seven months of 2020 topping last year’s total of $337 billion and 2018’s $146 billion.For Messari, the overall record for settlement is a firm rejection of the concept that cryptocurrencies cannot compete with legacy systems as a means of payment.“Many people think blockchains have failed as payment systems. The typical argument goes something like, ‘you can’t buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin, therefore it has failed as a payment system,’” it summarized. “Along this line of argument cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether also suffer from extreme volatility making them unable to serve as payments mediums. Both premises aren’t entirely inaccurate, but the conclusion definitely is. In fact it is about $1.3 trillion wrong.”Public blockchain settlement comparison. Source: Messari/ TwitterContinuing, researcher Ryan Watkins argued that it was unsuitable comparing blockchains to payment networks such as Visa.A better comparison would be the umbrella settlement systems of the fiat realm, such as Fedwire.“The purpose of these systems is to fully guarantee payments so that they cannot be repudiated, reversed, or charged back without agreement of the recipient, and they’re meant to settle immediately,” he wrote on Twitter.Cryptocurrency consumer payments are still firmly within the discovery phase. Many mainstream options represent a “bridge” to fiat, such as cryptocurrency debit cards.These, and anything else which is dependent on the fiat economy, are also subject to disruption due to centralized control of the underlying infrastructure. As Cointelegraph reported, the liquidation of Germany’s Wirecard earlier this month temporarily caused European cryptocurrency debit cards to stop working. Decentralized cryptocurrencies, and specifically Bitcoin, are designed to make it impossible for a third party to control network activity."
260,"Coinsquare’s CEO Cole Diamond and President Virgile Rostand will step down and pay a $1.6 million fine as part of an agreement with Canadian regulator the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). According to an announcement from the OSC following a July 21 hearing, Diamond and Rostand have agreed to resign from their positions at the cryptocurrency exchange and will pay around $750,000 and $670,000 in penalties, respectively. Coinsquare and the disgraced duo will also shoulder $223,000 in costs for the investigation. The Canadian regulator said Diamond and Rostand are effectively banned from resuming management of Coinsquare for at least three years as part of the settlement and are unable to act as “registrants and directors or officers of a registrant.” Chief Compliance Officer (COO) Felix Mazer had already resigned his position and paid $37,000 to the OSC, but will have a similar ban in place for one year.The settlement between Coinsquare, Diamond, Rostand, and Mazer comes after the Canadian regulator alleged on July 16 that the exchange had engaged in wash-trading — artificially inflating its trade volume through executing zero-fee market trades into their own orders. This practice creates the appearance of large trading activity without any assets actually changing hands and is an industry-wide problem. “Despite several employees raising concerns about inflated trading volumes, Coinsquare not only stuck with the practice, but lied to investors about it and retaliated against a whistleblower,” said Jeff Kehoe, Director of the Enforcement Branch at the OSC. “Being an innovator in our capital markets is not a free pass to disregard Ontario securities law.”As part of its agreement with the OSC, Coinsquare has admitted that it engaged in market manipulation by reporting inflated trading volumes and made “misleading statements to conceal the wash trades.” Between July 17, 2018 and Dec. 4, 2019, Coinsquare made roughly 840,000 wash trades with an aggregated value of 590,000 Bitcoin (BTC) — $5.5 billion at the time of writing. These trades represented more than 90% of the reported volume on the exchange.The problem of market manipulation with these types of trades is an endemic issue in the crypto industry. According to a study by Bitwise Asset Management, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2019, as much as 95% of the crypto market volumes reported to CoinMarketCap could have been the result of wash trading. The Blockchain Transparency Institute reported in September last year that the fake volume of BTC trades was roughly 50%."
261,"A known gold enthusiast, financial commentator Peter Schiff said Bitcoin (BTC) holders are not actually looking to the asset as a storage of wealth — one of the most commonly touted use cases surrounding the coin. ""I buy gold as a way to store my wealth, as a conservative place to keep liquidity, as opposed to keeping it in dollars or some other fiat currency,"" Schiff told interviewer Peter McCormack, host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, during a July 17 episode. ""I do think that when people are buying Bitcoin, they're really not looking for that,"" Schiff added. The crypto and blockchain industry commonly refers to Bitcoin as a store of value or place to park wealth. The asset has also received a number of comparisons against gold. According to Shiff, however, BTC owners actually want profit, not steady wealth protection against inflation. Schiff explained:Valued at less than a penny shortly after its 2009 launch, Bitcoin rocketed up to almost $20,000 per BTC at its all-time high in 2017, tallying unheard of profits for early investors. Bitcoin has held as a profitable investment for 89% of its lifetime, as of late 2019 Cointelegraph reporting. Given its astronomical price climb through the years, do asset holders subconsciously just want profits?""They think they're going to get rich on Bitcoin,"" Schiff said following up his comment on people's price expectations for the asset. ""I don't tell anybody they're going to get rich on gold, they're just not going to go broke with gold,"" Schiff explained. ""They're going to preserve their wealth that other people are going to lose.""Posing a contrary view, Bill Barhydt, CEO of financial investing and wallet platform Abra, said he sees the store of value narrative as Bitcoin's top use case at present.

262,"Ryan Radloff, CEO of custody solution Kingdom Trust, recently explained a vast number of Americans do not hold Bitcoin (BTC) in their retirement accounts. ""There's 7.1 million Americans that have already made the leap to buy Bitcoin or take the dive into our industry so to speak, and have a retirement account, but don't have Bitcoin in their retirement account,"" Radloff told Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano in a July 18 interview. Retirement accounts allow the public to put money into a long-term investment fund, with the stipulation of only taking money from that account after a certain time period — usually totalling decades, depending on the participants age. Such a format comes with significant tax breaks and incentives.Various solutions exist as gateways for Bitcoin retirement account purchases and investing, including an option from Kingdom Trust. According to Radloff, people have available capital in their retirement accounts for BTC, but have not pulled the trigger on buying. ""If you also look at people's investible, discretionary money, they usually have three to four times more investible discretionary money in their retirement accounts than they do in their non-retirement accounts,"" Radloff said. Bitcoin spells opportunity at present, given the number of people in the industry, matched with retirement account usage, Radloff noted. He said:Mentioning the trillions of dollars at play in the retirement market, Radloff also noted a lack of workable structure around crypto and blockchain companies offering 401k options to their employees.  Radloff's comment on opportunity comes with reference to Bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio, made by crypto Twitter analyst PlanB. The model essentially explains Bitcoin's inevitable rising price due to its decreasing mining reward payout and limited maximum supply. "
263,"For the last month Bitcoin (BTC) price has traded in a tight range and trading volume has been relatively flat. Meanwhile, several tokens on the Ethereum network have been topping the price charts, especially the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) tokens.New data from Messari shows that Ethereum has just surpassed Bitcoin as the network that settles the most value per day. This means that the dollar value on the transactions of both Ether (ETH) and its tokens is now higher than that of Bitcoin.Ethereum vs Bitcoin daily settlement value. Source: MessariWhile the DeFi sector has been gaining popularity, stablecoin transactions have been responsible for most of this volume, having settled over $508 billion in transactions over the course of 2020. This figure is nearly double the $253 billion settled in 2019.Tether (USDT) is the main stablecoin responsible for the volume and according to Messari, it could possibly surpass Bitcoin as the most transacted cryptocurrency in the market.USDT vs Bitcoin daily transaction value. Source: MessariBitcoin offers colored coins through protocols like Counterparty and Omni, but these assets pale in comparison to the smart contract capabilities of the Ethereum network, which continue to be showcased through the novel possibilities of DeFi. Coupled with lower fees and faster transaction times, Ethereum has become the chain of choice for centralized and decentralized stablecoins alike.While USDT was first issued on the Bitcoin blockchain, only 13.2% of its supply currently resides on BTC, while the Ethereum chain holds 59.8% of the USDT supply. As most of the USDT balance is held on Ethereum, USDT is also the biggest spender of gas in the network, according to data from ETH Gas Station.Led by USDT, the collective stablecoin market capitalization grew from $2.4 billion to around $8 billion in Q1 alone. Another $3.8 billion was added in the Q2, making the current figure over $12 billion, and approximately $9.18 billion belongs to Tether. Tether has also surpassed Ripple (XRP) as the third largest cryptocurrency.Stablecoin collective market capitalization. Source: MessariWhile inter-exchange settlement is the most popular use for stablecoins, DeFi has also been a considerable force in the growing activity seen on the Ethereum network. Because of their peg to fiat currencies, stablecoins are quite popular among DeFi lending protocols which have been gaining traction throughout 2020.The platforms have seen noticeable surges in the amount of funds locked and in Q2 the figure surged above $2 billion. Compound alone achieved a major milestone with over $1 billion assets borrowed in total.Stablecoins and growth within the DeFi sector are likely to continue driving transaction volume and settlement value on the Ethereum network but will the network be able to support this growth?Stablecoins already account for more than 70% of the total daily value settled and if the Ethereum network continues to have unresolved congestion and scalability problems there could be real problems within the DeFi platforms.For the time being, it’s unclear whether or not the Ethereum Network will be able to deal with the rapidly increasing stablecoin and DeFi activity, especially as corporations set their sights on the sector."
264,"Elena Tonoyan, the COO at LocalBitcoins, explains how the oldest peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange has been stepping up the fight against criminal activities on the platform.As of 2019, LocalBitcoins has been cited as the exchange receiving the most criminal funds for three years in a row, according to a report by CypherTrace.The results for 2020 will be much different, assures Tonoyan, referring to the stringent KYC/AML procedure adopted by the exchange in September last year.Results already appear to be visible. Citing recent data, Tonoyan claims that volumes sent to dark markets have already dropped by 70%.When asked about the verified LocalBitcoins accounts that are being sold on Russia’s darknet marketplace, Tonoyan pointed out that she is aware of the issue.“We block those accounts as soon as we are able to identify that they have been sold or hacked,” she said.By tightening verification procedures, Tonoyan admitted, the exchange lost a major competitive advantage which was customers’ anonymity.That seems to be the main reason behind a 50% drop in trading volume in the months following the implementation of the measures. However, Tonoyan thinks the tradeoff was worth it.“In the early days people used LocalBitcoins because it was anonymous. But nowadays they use LocalBitcoins because they want a safe and legit service to buy bitcoins,” she said.Don’t miss the full interview on our Youtube channel and remember to subscribe!"
265,"At the start of this week, Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility, or the average daily oscillation, dropped to its lowest level since November 2018 (when the infamous $6,000 support finally broke).Prior to today’s mild breakout to $9,437, the last significant move above 1% was on July 9 when the price dropped 2.1%. Generally, Bitcoin price has been trading in a tightening range for the past month so today’s move above the $9,400 resistance isn’t much of a deviation from the 30-day trading range.The last time Bitcoin showed similar price action was on October 30, 2018, when Bitcoin started an impressive 15 consecutive days of movements without a 1.5% oscillation. On November 14, 2018, this all changed as volatility spiked and led to a 42% crash to $3,650 in less than two weeks.Bitcoin historical volatility. Source: SkewThe above chart shows that the 10-day and 30-day historical volatility, which drastically reduced over the last three months. There’s no real explanation for such market behavior, although it’s not uncommon to see similar price action in traditional markets like oil, gold, and the S&P 500.Reduced historical volatility by itself can’t be deemed bullish nor bearish because it only states that past movements have been rather narrow. On the other hand, sudden significant moves tend to be preceded by stable periods.Such a narrow range trading is also known as a consolidation period and it tends to end with a sharp support/resistance break. This is due to the conflict between short-term traders betting on range continuation, while others exact the opposite.When the market starts trading within a tight range, leveraged traders betting on range continuation will tend to get liquidated in case of a breakout.Meanwhile there’s usually some active orders waiting for a trend rupture that are placed just outside the range. This price action exacerbates this effect, although sometimes it isn’t strong enough to break the pattern.BTC USD 2-hour chart.

Although there’s no clear rule for setting such a strategy, traders will usually seek the longer and narrower trading range.There might be a newer positive trend that formed on June 16 but the previous trend seems to be displaying more strength, at least for now.Traders are now wondering if the current situation will repeat the November 2018 crash? Looking at volatility alone, this is impossible to predict but for now investors seem content to profit from altcoins.Even today’s upside move to $9,437 hasn’t removed BTC price from its recent range and it's crucial to see the price flip the $9,400 level to support by the daily close.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

266,"Recently, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been showing virtually zero volatility. This volatility decreased particularly as of late while Bitcoin was resting on the crucial support level of $9,000.But on July 21 Bitcoin finally made a sudden move, as expected in the latest analysis, and the price surged from $9,100 to $9,400. So is volatility back or is this just nothing more than a blip? Let’s take a closer look.Crypto market daily performance. Source: TradingViewThe price of Bitcoin held the crucial support at $9,000 and broke upwards. However, the price of BTC is still inside the ascending triangle structure.This means that the price of the top-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization is continuously making higher lows since the March 12 crash. Since then, every previous resistance level got confirmed for support, initiating bullish support/resistance flips and further upwards continuation.BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe crucial area to hold was the range between $8,900-9,000 (on smaller timeframes). The recent low at $8,500-8,800 flipped into support already, after which the same occurred with the $8,900-9,000 range.Similarly, Bitcoin’s price is still acting above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs), which is a bullish signal. As long as Bitcoin’s price remains above these MAs, the market is in bull territory.However, a sudden massive surge is unlikely to occur, given that Bitcoin’s price is still acting inside an enormous range.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe likeliness of a $1,000 candle is getting higher once Bitcoin reclaims the untested levels, shown in the chart.Until then, the likelihood of continued range-bound movements persists. In this case, every previous level is likely to receive a test for confirmation of the breakout, after which the next level will likely get tested.The yet-untested levels in the previous month are $9,650, $9,800 and $10,100. Once the price of Bitcoin breaks through the $10,100 barrier, massive continuation is likely to occur with a giant surge.The $9,200 resistance broke earlier today, which immediately led to a surge to the $9,400 resistance zone.BTC/USDT 4-hour bullish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bullish scenario would mean a continuation toward the $9,600 level in one-go or a corrective move before continuation.In that regard, a retest of the previous level at $9,200 for support is not typical. If such a retest occurs, the next compression and breakout will likely open the door to $9,600 and possibly $9,800.As the chart shows, these movements are the exact opposite of what the market has witnessed previously. In the past month, the market witnessed an overall slip, though now the opposite is more likely in the coming weeks.Currently, the crucial support level to hold is $9,200 as this boosts the chances of more upside.BTC/USDT 4-hour bearish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bearish scenario also has the critical pivot at $9,200. In this scenario, the price of Bitcoin can’t break $9,400 and immediately loses the $9,200 support level.If that happens, a further downward drop is likely to be expected as the ascending triangle becomes invalid.The key levels to watch here include the crucial pivot at $9,200. Losing that level would warrant a test of the $8,400-8,700 area and possible continuation towards the $7,500 region.Overall, the market should sustain upward momentum as long as $9,200 holds, which also increases the chances of testing new yearly highs.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

267,"Since early 2020, the institutional demand for Bitcoin (BTC) has been steadily increasing. In the second quarter of this year, data show that the appetite for BTC spiked significantly. According to crypto asset fund Grayscale, its products recorded an inflow of $1.4 billion in capital. The investment firm is best known for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which allows institutions in the United States to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly-traded over-the-counter stock.If the demand for Bitcoin climbed steadily in the first three months of 2020, it surged rapidly from March to June. One possible explanation for the sudden increase in attraction toward Bitcoin is its crash in early March when Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped below $3,600 on BitMEX. More than $1 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated, but in the 72 hours that followed, the volumes in retail markets surged substantially, especially on platforms like Coinbase.Similar to their retail counterparts, institutional investors likely bought large amounts of BTC after the major correction. The assets under management of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust rose from $1.577 billion to $3 billion, from March 17 to May 13.Overall, three key data points show that the institutional demand for Bitcoin has been rising, particularly in Q2 2020.In a single quarter, Grayscale’s products recorded an inflow of nearly $1 billion. The $905.8 million quarterly inflow raised total inflows in the first half of 2020 to $1.4 billion. Grayscale’s half-year report reads: “Total investment into Grayscale’s family of products hit $905.8 million in 2Q20. To put that into context, that’s nearly 1.5x the capital raised during all of 2019, and following a record quarter in 1Q20.”The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is considered an accurate metric to measure institutional demand for Bitcoin since the U.S. and Europe have not yet approved an exchange-traded fund around Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. The absence of exchange-traded funds in the U.S. and Europe narrows down the options for accredited and institutional investors. Institutions can choose among the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, custodial services and direct OTC trades. But, custodial services are not widely-utilized, and direct OTC dealings can cause security vulnerabilities.Primarily due to a lack of options, institutions typically use the trust to gain exposure to Bitcoin despite its high market premium. Grayscale emphasized that 84% of investments came from institutional investors in the first half of 2020. The record-high quarterly inflow into Grayscale’s products and the fact that the overwhelming majority came from institutions suggest institutional demand surged in the second quarter.But in recent weeks, the rate of Grayscale’s accumulation of Bitcoin has slowed down. The filings of the investment firm with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed the company has not bought a single Bitcoin in three weeks. Speaking to Cointelegraph, a Grayscale spokesperson clarified that the trust was placed in an administrative quiet period, which is also called a “waiting period” by the SEC. The halt in purchases is temporary, and it does not necessarily mean that institutions have stopped buying BTC.Since January 2020, major banks across Asia, Europe and the U.S. have started to prepare crypto custodial services, indicating that they see a certain level of demand for Bitcoin from clients. In January, Switzerland’s third-biggest bank, Julius Baer, partnered with Seba to launch digital assets services.Two months later, South Korea’s largest bank, Kookmin, filed a trademark application for a crypto custodian solution. Speaking to a local publication called Digital Today, a Kookmin Bank spokesperson said the trademark is related to its partnership with Atomrigs Lab in 2019, which was brought about to develop a custodian platform called KBDAC. Local analysts said that the bank is likely far into product development at this point.This week, Standard Chartered reportedly confirmed to be developing a crypto custody solution.Standard Chartered’s venture and innovations arm called SV Ventures is attempting to aid the start of the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. The firm’s entrance into the cryptocurrency market suggests that it has been seeing growing demand for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, in the global market.Major financial institutions portrayed a pessimistic stance toward cryptocurrencies in the past several years. Executives of Visa, Mastercard and other financial service providers have previously criticized Bitcoin and crypto assets.In October 2017, as Cointelegraph reported, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga said cryptocurrencies that are not government-mandated are “junk.” Yet on July 20, Mastercard announced the launch of a crypto card partner program. It would allow cryptocurrency companies to distribute Mastercard payment cards through a Mastercard principal membership. The program shows a 180-degree shift from the Mastercard CEO’s stance toward non-government cryptocurrencies in 2017. Raj Dhamodharan, the executive vice president at Mastercard’s digital asset department, said:“The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and Mastercard is driving it forward, creating safe and secure experiences for consumers and businesses in today’s digital economy. Our work with Wirex and the wider crypto ecosystem is accelerating innovation and empowering consumers with more choice in the way they pay.”Visa, which has also canceled crypto debit cards in the past, established a partnership with Bitcoin Lightning Network startup Zap. Mastercard and Visa’s initiatives to build an infrastructure around cryptocurrencies as a potential long-term strategy have demonstrated the growing perception of cryptocurrencies as legitimate tools of payment and store of value.Strategist Lyn Alden echoed a similar sentiment in her recently-published investment thesis on Bitcoin. Alden noted that she has become optimistic about Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. Apart from the halving, scarcity and the network effect of Bitcoin, she said the presence of major businesses in the crypto industry is a positive factor for growth:“Some major businesses are already on board, apart from the ones that grew from crypto-origins like Coinbase. Square’s (SQ) Cash App enables the purchase of Bitcoin, for example. Robinhood, which has enjoyed an influx of millions of new users this year, has built-in cryptocurrency trading, making an easy transition for Robinhood users.”In the long-term, the consistent increase in inflows from institutional investors into Bitcoin, supplemented by a strengthening crypto infrastructure, could largely benefit Bitcoin. The introduction of alternative investment vehicles to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, like an ETF or an exchange-traded note, could further bolster institutional demand for Bitcoin."
268,"Wirecard chief operating officer Jan Marsalek reportedly used Bitcoin (BTC) to move funds from Dubai to Russia.Russian media outlet Kommersant reported on July 20 that Marsalek is hiding in Russia with funds that he was able to transfer there with the cryptocurrency.Per the report, Marsalek is currently in a private house near Moscow under the supervision of Russian special services. Documents leaked earlier this month also suggest that Marsalek indeed had links with Russian government operators. According to a recent report, he allegedly held secret documents and bragged of his intelligence service ties in an effort to further integrate with London traders.The scandal involving Marsalek started in late June, when auditors from Big Four accounting company EY could not confirm the existence of over $2.1 billion in cash in Wirecards books.Marsalek had seemingly gone missing after a purported trip to the Philippines last month to chase down the missing funds. However, some suggested that Russia’s Federal Security Service may have helped him forge documents showing that he entered the Philippines.News of the missing funds have since led Wirecard to file for insolvency and spurred the arrest of the firm's CEO, Markus Braun, in Germany. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Wirecard managed many major crypto-powered debit cards and its demise was seen as a potential blow to the crypto community. Affected crypto cards include the ones issued by companies like Crypto.com and TenX.Still, shortly after the initial suspension, European crypto cards managed by Wirecard were reactivated following permission from the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority."

He said:“We've got our breaker and bullish move here, as the market is showing strength. I don't think $BTC will accelerate, as it's just still hopping around.”Binance Futures data shows that the majority of traders on the platform are majority long on Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).Data from Datamish suggests there are substantially more long contracts than shorts in the entire Bitcoin futures market as well. Longs amount to 22,496 BTC, worth around $209 million. In contrast, shorts stand at a mere 5,555 BTC, worth less than $52 million.Although the 200-day MA technically suggests an uptrend, historical data shows it could easily break down below it. Previous peaks witnessed in July 2019 and February 2020 both rejected above the 200-day MA.Data from Santiment also shows that the volume of Bitcoin has declined in recent weeks. When an uptrend coincides with declining volume, it could hint at a fakeout.Researchers at Santiment wrote:“BTC's overall trading volume continues to slide, and with so much focus on altcoins currently, Bitcoin's trading volume hitting a daily value of $12.25B Saturday marked the lowest single-day value since October 5, 2019 (a 9.5-month low).”The trading volume of Bitcoin continues to decline.

270,"Cybersecurity experts are warning that the Twitter hack on July 15 shows that the social network needs to strengthen its security in order to avoid a worse black swan scenario with serious consequences.In the most recent incident, attackers launched a crypto giveaway scam by posting phishing messages through the hijacked profiles of celebrities and high-ranked political personalities worldwide, collecting over 13 Bitcoin (BTC) from the victims.Ilya Sachkov, CEO of threat intelligence firm Group-IB, believes the attack demonstrated a “huge problem of low financial literacy and bad cyber hygiene.” He told Cointelegraph:  “This could have ended far worse, affecting the stock market heavily or even resulting in a geopolitical catastrophe. This is the least they could have done with the God-mode access they had.”James Carder, chief security officer and vice president of LogRhytm Labs, said that amid international efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, hackers are “quickly taking advantage and exploiting the uncertainty of this time” for their financial gain.Carder said that experts need to evaluate how the attack was possible and pointed out the need to strengthen social media platforms in terms of privacy:“This hack also brings into concern why — in the first place — Twitter granted its employees with the functionality to tweet on behalf of their customers. It is clear that social media organizations need the ability to manage accounts, and particularly the ability to take down offensive or inappropriate content, the employees should not have access to post an entirely unique Tweet on a user’s behalf. This points to a likely case of too much functionality available in the platform and not enough robust controls.”Brett Callow, threat analyst at malware lab Emsisoft, said that the subsequent security efforts taken by Twitter likely aren't enough to preclude the possibility of another such incident in the future.“While Twitter will no doubt work to improve its security, the fact is that there is no completely sure-fire way to prevent account take-overs and similar incidents will almost certainly happen again, though hopefully not on this scale,” he said.As Cointelegraph previously reported, the hackers who conducted the massive Twitter hijacking do not appear to be sophisticated Bitcoin users, as they left trails leading to and from major exchanges that presumably hold the keys to their identities."
271,"The U.S. economy is experiencing a shortage of coins. With this in mind, the Community State Bank, or CSB, of Milwaukee is offering a five percent premium to customers who turn in coins to one of its locations. Meanwhile Bitcoin (BTC) is not expected to run out of Satoshis anytime soon.CSB announcing “Crazy time”. Source:  CSB Site.This issue apparently stems from further complications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Reasons given include that the U.S. Mint reduced coinage to protect its employees, and that U.S. consumers have been trying to avoid cash transactions as much as possible. Many believe that the recent crisis will serve as a catalyst for the transitioning to the cashless economy.As far as we know, Bitcoin has not run into a similar problem and is not expected to do so in the future. As of today, there are 18.44 million Bitcoins or 1.84 quadrillion Satoshis in circulation. If at some point 1 Satoshi were to become too valuable due to the asset’s massive appreciation, the community could implement a hard fork to introduce an even smaller unit. Perhaps, an apt name for the new base denomination would be “CSW”.Last month, the U.S. Mint went back to work and is expected to produce 19.8 billion coins by the end of the year."
272,"A recent report by blockchain tracking and analytics provider, Whale Alert, revealed that the miner known as Patoshi mined over $10.9 billion or 1,125,150 BTC during Bitcoin’s infancy in order to protect the network from a 51% attack. Patoshi has been confirmed to be the anonymous Bitcoin creator known as Satoshi and the early blocks mined by Patoshi also include the first BTC transaction to Hall Finney, a well known developer and early Bitcoin contributor.Whale Alert was able to come to this conclusion by reviewing previous research conducted by independent researcher and cryptographer Sergio Lerner. Lerner coined the term Patoshi miner back when a cryptographic pattern that revealed most of the early Bitcoin mining was done by one individual with access to modified mining software. The Patoshi Pattern. Source: Whale AlertIn the chart above, the Patoshi pattern is visualized and it reveals that the straight lines are using the standard Bitcoin mining software and the “saw-like” lines are attributed to Patoshi. This same pattern allowed Whale Alert to discover that the Patoshi miner “adjusted its speed between blocks” in order to keep the average block time at 0.6 blocks per 10 minutes. Based on the patterns left by the miner on some of the code that is stored in each Bitcoin block, Whale Alert also concluded that this early Bitcoin mining operation was composed of up to 48 computers and one of them was responsible for coordination.According to Whale Alert, there are two reasons for adjusting the speed, to either keep the block time near the 10 minute mark or to protect the network from a 51% attack. Satoshi kept his share of the hashrate at a steady 60% as the network grew and a 51% attack was a major threat for Bitcoin at that time, as it has been for newer cryptocurrencies in recent times. It seems likely that Satoshi was trying to protect the Bitcoin network but as it became less prone to malicious attacks he reduced Patoshi’s block creation rate to 1 block per 10 minutes.Blocks mined per 10 minutes per Patoshi chain. Source: Whale AlertMany analysts believe Satoshi stopped mining at block 54,316 once he deemed the network sufficiently decentralized. However, there have been some irregularities in later blocks that span up until May 2010 or block 112,500, but currently these cannot be confirmed as Patoshi or Satoshi. The actions of the Patoshi miner appear to be meticulously calculated and geared towards the protection of the network as the global Bitcoin hashrate increased and mining picked up. It seems unlikely that this same entity would want to sell some of the Bitcoin supply and this would have a deteriorating effect for the BTC network. Whale Alert concludes as much by saying:“The timing of the shutdown, the mining behavior, the systematic decrease in mining speed and the lack of spending strongly suggest that Satoshi was only interested in growing and protecting the young network. The bitcoin mined by Patoshi were possibly a mere byproduct of these efforts and it is unlikely that the remainder will ever be spent, although the question remains why Satoshi didn’t simply burn them in this case.”According to an early Bitcoin developer, Satoshi feared a 51% attack so much that he even had a GPU ready to defend the network, although it was not used to keep mining somewhat balanced. Lerner also believes that the Patoshi miner’s actions were not motivated by financial gain and according to Lerner, “Satoshi won't use his coins ever”."
273,"According to Marshall Hayner, an early Bitcoin (BTC) adopter, Adam Back had a beer with Satoshi Nakamoto in London.Metal Pay CEO Marshall Hayner told Cointelegraph a story he heard from Back at a party in Los Gatos some years ago. The party was thrown to celebrate the formation of Blockstream and its successful capital raise.Hayner said that he was invited to the party by Austin Hill, who was Blockstream’s CEO at the time. The community was small and closely knit, with only a select few people in attendance. Allegedly, after a few drinks, the topic of Satoshi Nakamoto came up. This supposedly prompted Back, who has often been seen as a popular Satoshi candidate himself, to say: “Yeah, I met him once”. When pressed for more details, Back reportedly refused to elaborate further, stating:“I don't want to say too much. But he is a British guy and I met him in London and went to the pub and had a beer. I think he might be an MI6.”Hayner does not remember Back specifying when this meeting took place, but assumes it would have been sometime between 2009-2010. It is interesting to note that rumors have percolated for years with regard to Bitcoin originating from one or more intelligence agencies.Hayner recalled that several individuals closely associated with Back and Blockstream were present as well. Among them were the aforementioned Austin Hill and Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin Core developer. Cointelegraph contacted Back, Hill, and Maxwell about their recollection of events.Back unequivocally denied that he had ever met Satoshi Nakamoto, and maintains that he never told this story:“No, I would not have said that for it is not true; as far as I know no one (who is not making up stories) has claimed to have met Satoshi in person.” — He added “Also I do not know who Marshall Hayner is and did not interact with him on this topic.”Maxwell’s response echoed Back’s. He confirmed to be present at the party, but denied hearing this story:“I have no recollection of Adam saying anything like that, and I would remember it if I'd heard it: It would have been inconsistent with everything I've ever heard Adam say on the subject before or since, and also inconsistent with my understanding of the history of Bitcoin (it's my belief that --as far as we know-- no one in the community has met Satoshi).”Maxwell also added that he consulted with his partner, who was also present at the party. They did not recall this conversation either.Hill did not respond to Cointelegraph’s inquiry.Before retelling this story to us, Hayner said there is no way Adam Back would ever acknowledge it. If Hayner’s recollection is accurate, this would be the first confirmed “sighting” of Satoshi. Although Back did not corroborate Hayner’s supposed recollection, the story would seem to confirm the often posited British origins of Bitcoin’s creator.Had Satoshi wanted to meet someone from the crypto community in person, perhaps to show their gratitude, there would not be many better candidates than Back, whose Hashcash served as one of the main building blocks of Bitcoin.This article was amended on July 20 2020 4:30 PM ET.After this article was published, Cointelegraph received an email from Austin Hill in which he in no uncertain terms denied Hayner’s account of events, calling his story “bullshit”. Hill noted that from the beginning, the Blockstream team agreed to not speculate on Satoshi’s identity as it “ran counter to cypherpunk ideals”. He stated that best to his knowledge, Back never veered from this policy and had he done so, he would have “taken Adam to task for violating policy.”"

The growth for every other asset decelerated for every other cryptocurrency with most experiencing a double digit decline. Tezos’ exceptional performance may be explained by its low base (low growth rate) in the first quarter.Co-Founder & CEO of The Tie, Joshua Frank, told Cointelegraph that likely one of the reasons for this trend is the fact that eToro began to focus more on commission free equity trading:“eToro has begun to have a more global focus on commission free equity trading as stock trading has begun to soar in the wake of coronavirus. eToro users have increasingly looked towards trading equities rather than cryptocurrencies over the last few months.”We should note that in absolute numbers, only Zcash (ZEC) saw a smaller increase in the second quarter with 1.40%. While many cryptocurrencies experienced growth several magnitudes higher than Tezos — 46.01% for XRP (XRP) and 31.31% for Bitcoin (BTC).Nonetheless, Frank believes that eTore users have still retained quite an appetite for crypto as each of the top assets gained almost 1 million new followers:“Nearly 1 million new eToro accounts began following the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP pages this month. This signals that while broadly there may be a bit more of an equity shift, existing and new eToro users most definitely continue to have an appetite for cryptocurrencies.”Perhaps, another reason for the deceleration in growth can be explained by the low volatility of the crypto markets and the stabilization of the traditional ones."

If the bulls who are sitting on the sidelines jump in and buy aggressively above $9,500, it could pose a serious challenge to the $10,000–$10,500 zone, above which a sustained up move is likely.On the other hand, if the price slips below $8,800, the short-term traders owning long positions might cover them, which could drag the BTC/USD pair to $8,130.58. This is an important level to watch out for because if this support breaks down it could result in a deeper correction.It is very difficult to predict with certainty which of the above scenarios would play out.

276,"A new version of Russia’s major draft bill on cryptocurrency regulation does not include criminal offense codes as lawmakers are expected to hold the bill's second reading tomorrow.According to official records of the State Duma, Russia’s legislative body, the Duma’s Committee on Financial Market has proposed the second reading of the bill “On Digital Financial Assets,” or DFA, on Tuesday.In the Russian legislative system, each bill is subject to three readings as it passes the development from draft to adoption. While the second reading is designed to sum up amendments and proposals to the draft bill, the third reading is associated with final adoption.According to the draft bill document published on Monday, the proposed legislation does not intend to introduce criminal liability such as fines and prison terms for illegal use of crypto in Russia.Anatoly Aksakov, a member of the State Duma and a major official behind the legislation, confirmed the news to local news agency RIA Novosti. “This bill will not include liability,” Aksakov said, noting that the committee decided to abandon the idea of introducing the administrative and criminal offense codes to the bill.According to Aksakov, the DFA bill is likely to pass in July. He expects it to be enforced starting Jan. 1, 2021.As previously reported, Russian politicians were considering major punishments for illegal usage of cryptocurrencies in May. The officials suggested fines up to nearly $30,000 as well as seven-year jail terms for violations such as illegal turnover and issuance of crypto. According to media reports, the proposals were part of the DFA bill.However, the DFA will not be the sole part of Russia’s upcoming crypto legislation, as there is also another bill that is called “On Digital Currency,” or DC. Aksakov elaborated that the bill “On Digital Currency” is a separate document that would actually determine crypto regulation, while the DFA bill only provides key industry terms like the notion of a “digital asset.”According to Aksakov, the State Duma expects to pass the bill “On Digital Currency” during the autumn session, which ends in late December.The history of crypto legislation development in Russia has seen a number of delays in moving forward since early 2018. First introduced in January 2018, the DFA bill was delayed multiple times despite Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, ordering it to be adopted at least twice. Eventually, Aksakov admitted that the delays were caused by disagreement on the new asset type between a number of local authorities."
277,"Top five Swiss bank Julius Baer Group, which manages $427 billion in assets, announced on July 20 that its profit increased by $524 million in the last two quarters. The bank most likely benefited from an increase in trading revenues throughout the U.S. and Europe.The profit of Julius Baer reportedly spiked by 34% in the first half of 2020. It coincides with the bank’s introduction of a custodial service for digital assets — like Bitcoin (BTC) — in January.The trend of major banks in the second quarter of 2020 suggests a massive increase in trading revenues. The pandemic and the introduction of stimulus packages drove a retail “fear of missing out” (FOMO) rally in the stock market.The noticeable increase in retail demand for stocks led the revenues of banks, especially for trading departments, to surge. JPMorgan, as an example, earned $4.7 billion in net income in the second quarter of 2020. The U.S. investment bank posted its highest quarterly revenue in history.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on July 14:""We earned $4.7 billion of net income in the second quarter despite building $8.9 billion of credit reserves because we generated our highest quarterly revenue ever, which demonstrates the benefit of our diversified global business model.”Like other banks, the rise in Julius Baer’s profit likely comes from heightened levels of retail trading since the start of April. While Bitcoin recorded high volatility from March to May, since June onwards, it has seen historically low levels of volatility.Stocks have been significantly more volatile in recent weeks. Sellers and buyers triggered large short-term movements in the stock market, as the anticipation of new stimulus continuously increased.But, as Coinbase explained, Bitcoin saw a big spike in demand from retail users in the aftermath of “Black Thursday.” On March 13, BTC dropped to as low as sub-$3,600, causing havoc in the cryptocurrency market.The price of Bitcoin dropped to sub-$3,600 in March. Source: TradingView.comIn the following two months since the massive correction, Bitcoin saw a 190% rally from $3,600 to $10,440. Since Julius Baer added support for digital assets in January, it might have benefited from Bitcoin’s volatility from March to May.Julius Baer said on January 21:“Julius Baer has extended its service range and as of now includes digital assets offerings such as secure storage and transaction solutions […]. The Bank is able to offer access to a select group of cryptocurrencies, chosen for their tradability, safety, and technical reliability.”Since early 2020, an increasing number of major financial institutions have started to support Bitcoin exchanges.On May 12, for instance, JPMorgan Chase added Coinbase and Gemini as its clients. This suggests that major banks are starting to embrace the new asset class. In previous years, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon heavily criticized Bitcoin, saying “it’s not a real thing” according to CNBC.The spike in profit of increasingly crypto-friendly banks, such as Julius Bear and JPMorgan, appears to be another sign of increasing institutional demand and the improving perception of Bitcoin as an alternative asset class."
278,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) begins a new week, ranging north of $9,000 as it awaits cues from macro markets. What could be in store for the coming days?Cointelegraph takes a look at the major factors that could impact BTC's price this week. Equities led a somewhat uneventful start to the week’s trading, with major stocks' futures slightly down on the day — by a maximum of 0.6% at press time.Bitcoin likewise had a quiet weekend, with volatility remaining negligible and a narrow trading corridor continuing to characterize price performance.On Monday, BTC/USD hovered at around $9,180, having hit local highs of $9,226 earlier — its highest since July 15.As has become standard in recent weeks, coronavirus sentiment and reactions to associated remedial measures from governments and central banks dictate macro action, and Bitcoin remains susceptible to copycat moves.With calm reigning prior to the opening bell on Wall Street, room for maneuver appeared limited, given the “compression” in BTC/USD over the past several weeks. A cycle of higher lows and lower highs, the current compression cycle showed little sign of breaking this month. As Cointelegraph reported, however, the status quo is ripe for change — and that should happen this week, say analysts.“This feels like a little World Cup of sorts. #bitcoin could break out on or about the 22nd,” Jason Williams, co-founder of crypto hedge fund Morgan Creek Digital, tweeted on Sunday.Investors should not treat Bitcoin as a safe haven “too literally” within the current market, says the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance.Speaking to Bloomberg on July 20, Changpeng Zhao, known as “CZ” in cryptocurrency circles, cautioned against considering BTC/USD as having a particular relationship to stocks.“I think people should not take that meaning of 'safe haven assets' too literally… there are always multiple factors affecting the price of an asset,” he told the network.“If you imagine Bitcoin as the same as a float and there’s the Titanic sinking beside it, if there’s a rope tying the float to the Titanic, then the float will sink down with the Titanic, even though the float does have floating properties — it’s just not able to sustain that kind of load.” As Cointelegraph reported, quant analysis has suggested that Bitcoin is 95% correlated to the S&P 500. CZ added, however, that fiat inflation and its impact on investor holdings would ultimately increase Bitcoin’s safe haven profile over time. On the topic of safe havens, attention stayed focused on gold over the weekend. Similarly, as a result of coronavirus fallout, the precious metal is now up 19% year to date.Even in the eyes of mainstream media, appetite exists among investors for an exit from fiat, which has been tarnished by central bank money printing and lower interest rates.According to Bank of America Securities’ commodities strategist, Michael Widmer, gold may have even more room for growth than its current nine-year highs.“We need a little bit more visibility before gold prices start peaking,” he told CNBC.Data from on-chain monitoring resource Skew, meanwhile, confirms that Bitcoin has firmly beaten gold’s year-to-date gains: 27.7% versus 18.4%.Bitcoin versus gold 1-year chart. Source: SkewBinance further reported significant growth in its futures products focused on altcoins, contrasting with a tailing off in activity for Bitcoin.In July alone, the exchange’s altcoin perpetual futures volume grew 150% to $5.1 billion from $2 billion, while daily volume on altcoin futures hit $2 billion.This, it said in an accompanying blog post, underscores investor attention concentrating on altcoin markets in the wake of uninspiring Bitcoin price action.“The unusual stagnation in Bitcoin’s price has shifted investors’ appetite towards altcoins as prices surged to new all-time highs,” the blog post stated. “This explosion in Altcoin demand has ushered in an altcoin season, as seen by Bitcoin’s declining market capitalization dominance.”Bitcoin futures aggregated daily volumes 1-month chart. Source: SkewWhich direction a Bitcoin price breakout could take is open to debate, however. Analysis suggests a pullback of 11%, in line with support as part of the current descending price channel.At the same time, Bitcoin network fundamentals and miner sentiment remain conspicuously strong. Difficulty is forecast for another 6.3% rise in seven days’ time, which will constitute its highest level ever. Likewise, the average hash rate remains near its historical all-time highs.Bitcoin difficulty 2-month average chart.

279,"Changpeng Zhao, CEO of crypto exchange Binance, isn’t sure what will cause Bitcoin to hit $10,000 again, but has remarked on the token’s recent stability.In a July 19 interview with Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia, Zhao, also known as CZ, commented on the cryptocurrency’s record low volatility. Bitcoin (BTC) has had very few big moves for weeks, with the token remaining between $9,000 and $9,500. BTC is priced at $9,175 at press time.“I think sooner or later it’s going to break out,” CZ said. “But right now Bitcoin has been really stable. People have been calling it a stablecoin now.”The Binance CEO said that for the moment, Bitcoin was too correlated with traditional markets to be the safe haven asset many investors hope it can be.“It has a drag down effect,” CZ said, comparing the price of certain assets to floats adjacent to the Titanic, going down in a massive market crash:“The stock market is probably a thousand times bigger than the crypto market. When that goes down, and a lot of people are losing a lot of money, many of those people who have crypto investments will want to convert those investments into cash.”However, over the long haul, the Binance CEO says “the safe haven properties of Bitcoin will come through over time.”CZ’s observation on Bitcoin’s stability comes just a few days after the third anniversary of John McAfee saying he would “eat his own dick on national television” if the price did not hit a bullish $500,000 within three years. It wasn’t until May that the entrepreneur finally called the bet “nonsense” and a joke."
280,"Barry Silbert, CEO of cryptocurrency investment firm Grayscale Investments and Digital Currency Group, believes the United States is past the point of no return for banning Bitcoin. In a Grayscale investor call on July 16, the CEO said he was “cautiously optimistic” about the chances of regulations in the U.S. improving or at least not getting worse for the cryptocurrency. ""For the first time ever, we are past the 'ban bitcoin' perceived risk,"" Silbert said. ""There's enough support in DC from policy makers and regulators that Bitcoin has a right to exist and ultimately you can't shut it down.""The CEO said relationships with regulators are much better off due to the effort made by groups including the Blockchain Association — a group speaking out in favor of many blockchain and crypto companies in front of the SEC — and Coin Center, a non-profit crypto advocacy group. “As an industry, we're just much better off than we've ever been from a relationship perspective out in DC. [These two groups are] educating policy makers around the benefits of this technology in this asset class. The catastrophic regulatory policy risk that maybe would have existed previously in DC is behind us.”Cointelegraph has reported that Grayscale reported a substantial increase in the inflow of cryptocurrencies for Q2 2020, which totaled $905.8 million. This was up from $503.7 million in Q1."
281,"Coming every Sunday, Hodler’s Digest will help you track every single important news story that happened this week. The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.This week, Twitter and Bitcoin suffered a PR disaster. In a coordinated, ambitious attack, about 130 high-profile accounts were hijacked. Top celebrities, entrepreneurs, politicians, businesses and crypto exchanges were affected. Many posted similar tweets that promised followers that Bitcoin payments sent to a specific address would be doubled. Fraudulent messages were speedily deleted — but on some profiles, such as Elon Musk’s, they quickly reappeared again. Twitter had little choice but to suspend all verified accounts as it struggled to get on top of the breach. It’s estimated the attackers received 375 payments worth $120,000 as a result of the attack, with one Japanese wallet sending $40,000 in BTC. Blockchain intelligence firms have said some of the crypto has been moved and sent through mixing services, and the FBI has launched an investigation.The attack has been described as a threat to national security. We still don’t know whether the criminals managed to access sensible information found in direct messages. It seems the scammers were able to succeed with their audacious hack because employees have high levels of access to information and control on the platform. Twitter has vowed to add more security measures in an announcement that smacks of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. Tron founder Justin Sun is offering a reward of $1 million to those who track down the attackers. Early detective work suggests the hackers aren’t sophisticated Bitcoin users as they left trails leading to and from major exchanges that presumably hold the keys to their identities. Research from Whitestream indicates they appear to be consolidating their funds to an address that had earlier sent money to BitPay and Coinbase.One mystery behind the hack is how the attackers obtained access to so many high-profile accounts. Some theories suggest it was an “inside job” and the work of a disgruntled former or current Twitter employee. Others claimed it was clear that the hackers had a “super low IQ” as anyone with access to so many influential accounts could have easily chosen to manipulate the markets through FUD rather than run giveaway scams. One journalist, Josh Barro, tweeted: “You know, we wouldn’t have to worry about this sort of thing if cryptocurrency was illegal. I’m not kidding. Crypto has no socially beneficial uses and quite a few socially harmful uses. Why is it allowed?” This argument was quickly shot down in flames — with others pointing out how Twitter’s centralized controls led to this mess in the first place. As Anthony Pompliano tweeted: “Twitter was hacked. Bitcoin has never been hacked.”Let’s move on to some other news now. Bitcoin prices largely snoozed through the Twitter fiasco — remaining oddly serene and stuck in the low $9,000s. Cointelegraph analyst Michaël van de Poppe says there’s conflict in the markets, as both bullish and bearish arguments exist. He believes the bullish scenario is primarily built around breaking through the $9,200 resistance level, while the bearish scenario involves rejecting $9,200 and then losing support at $9,000. Van de Poppe added: “As Bitcoin’s price is most likely going to accelerate once it breaks above the $10,500 barrier, the opposite is true for the bearish case if $8,600 support does not hold. This is likely because there aren’t many support levels beneath $8,600, suggesting that the price can quickly drop $1,000 in a few hours as traders’ stop/losses may also add to downward pressure with the price dropping below a critical two-month-long support level. The next major support level beneath $8,600 is the $7,500 range.”PayPal has confirmed that it is developing capabilities in the cryptocurrency space in a letter to the European Commission. In the letter, the payments giant said it was “continuously monitoring and evaluating developments in the crypto and blockchain/distributed ledger space.” The company also stressed that it favors a “harmonized” regulatory approach that wouldn’t compromise innovation. Earlier in June, it was reported that PayPal was considering introducing direct sales of crypto assets and offering users to store their crypto using the company’s in-house digital wallet. When asked to confirm or deny this, a representative told Cointelegraph that “PayPal does not comment on rumors or speculation.” Around the same time, PayPal announced two crypto-related openings, as it was looking for blockchain and crypto engineers.At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $9,119.49, Ether at $233.83 and XRP at $0.19.

The pandemic has forced congress to go digital.”Perianne Boring, Chamber of Digital Commerce founder“BTC bulls need to reclaim $9,400 quick sharp.”filbfilb, Cointelegraph Markets analystIn July 2017, John McAfee boldly predicted that Bitcoin would hit $500,000 within three years — proclaiming he would “eat his own dick” on national television if he was wrong. Last year, he doubled down on that bet — and said he was adamant BTC would hit $1 million. Now, in a sign that such wild predictions aren’t to be trusted, McAfee has said he never believed Bitcoin would reach seven figures, describing it as an “old, tired worthless coin.” (Note: He’s previously said that his predictions were a joke designed to encourage newcomers to buy BTC.) Bitcoin investor and TV host Max Keiser sarcastically said that McAfee must be recovering in hospital after following through on his promise. “John McAfee honored his bet, made three years ago, to bite off his dick if Bitcoin wasn’t at $500,000. GOOD NEWS: He’s doing well at the hospital and expected to make a full recovery,” he said.A Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter has revealed he was one of the poor souls who missed out on Bitcoin’s all-time high in 2017 after misplacing his coins. Craig Jones, who is based in Australia, had bought the crypto in 2015 when the price was roughly $200–$400. Unfortunately for him, the 29-year-old champion couldn’t cash in when the price topped $20,000. He said: “Me and a couple of mates bought some bitcoin for s----s and giggles and then forgot about it almost immediately. Then when things went crazy a couple of years later we were all frantically trying to work out who had the password but nobody could remember how to get our account back.” Now that’s a body blow.A Texas resident has been accused of fraudulently filing loan applications for $1.1 million through the Paycheck Protection Program. Although he claimed he was seeking COVID-19 relief, it’s claimed he actually used the funds to purchase cryptocurrency. Joshua Thomas Argires submitted applications on behalf of two companies named “Texas Barbecue” and “Houston Landscaping,” falsely claiming that both businesses had numerous employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars in payroll expenses. According to a federal criminal complaint, he then began a series of transactions that ultimately resulted in $956,250 being transferred into a Coinbase account. Officials claim the 29-year-old committed wire fraud, and he has been charged by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.Two Italian 17-year-olds have been arrested for paying Bitcoin to see children sexually abused, tortured and murdered on live streams. The deep web website used by the teenagers also allowed users to pay extra to decide what torture the children would be subjected to next. According to local media, viewers could request for hot oil to be poured over a victim, or for their arm to be amputated. The two were searched as part of an ongoing investigation that has so far involved 25 people — 19 minors and six over 18 — residing in 13 Italian provinces. It is unclear whether the website offering the services was shut down, but presumably, only some of its viewers were caught.The recent Twitter hack shows us that centralized infrastructure is still vulnerable — but Oleksii Konashevych argues blockchain can change the paradigm.High-profile investors are concerned about the possibility of rising inflation — and they are turning to cryptocurrency to hedge against it.

282,"Since Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $19,000 in 2017, crypto analysts have issued an amazingly wide range of price predictions on the date and value of the next all-time high or low. Sometimes these predictions are rooted in deep fundamental and technical analysis, whereas other times they are simply nothing more than off-the-cuff estimates issued at whim. Options markets provide useful insights into traders' expectations, including mathematical probabilities for an asset's future prices. Using Black & Scholes model allows one to better assess the likelihood of analysts' estimates. The Black & Scholes valuation algorithm has been the basis for the pricing of options on traditional assets since the early 1970s, and remains widely used.   Although the Black & Scholes option pricing model tends to underestimate the odds of substantial movements, it does provide precise and conservative estimates. Similar to weather forecasting, adding more than a couple of days to an estimate reduces its precision by a logarithmic proportion. One must also consider that the model has to predict a binary outcome because a $9,500 option will be deemed worthless if the expiry price is $9,499.Many analysts tend to exaggerate their estimates to make a bold statement and attract media attention, or their predictions are based on various types of bias. No one expects gold bugs like Peter Schiff to draw a bullish Bitcoin estimate, and the same can be said for expecting a bearish prediction from Stock-to-Flow model author PlanB.The question investors should be asking is exactly how far off were those estimates compared to Bitcoin options pricing? Furthermore, should one even consider these analysts and pundits opinions?Although the Black & Scholes options pricing model can be complicated, it's usage is pretty straight forward. By informing the current BTC price, strike level, days until expiry, and annual volatility, the model will instantly provide the odds above and below a specific price.Skipping the complex calculations, one can refer to Skew Analytics to find current probabilities for each expiry based on options pricing.Bitcoin probability at options maturity. Source: DeribitMost active option strikes expire on the last Friday of every month. As previously explained, those figures will seem conservative. Both August and September strikes signify a mere 50% probability that Bitcoin price will remain above $9,000. A 50% odd should is effectively neutral, as the mathematical model states that odds above and below such target are pretty much the same.By contrast, the probability for a $8,500 on the July expiry (just two weeks from now) sits at 76%. The model becomes more confident as we approach maturity, so one should not expect options to price 90% plus odds for contracts with more than two weeks left.To assert whether analysts and pundits' predictions fare better than options markets pricing, one needs to stack those odds against the Black & Scholes options model, which requires four basic inputs: current price, strike (prediction), days until expiry, and implied volatility.Bitcoin price and pundits predictions. Source: TradingViewThe above chart depicts six predictions over a 100 day period, which will be individually tested against the options markets model.Despite having said numerous times that he isn't an active trader, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao often likes to publicize his predictions. In early November, CZ declared that BTC would hit $16K 'soonish,' so one should assume four months.CZ missed the mark by 35% as Bitcoin failed to break $10,500 level within four months. This was not a lousy call, but rather way too optimistic as indicated by the Black & Scholes model.Analyst Willy Woo reflected on the previous year cycle low of $3,100 and estimated that Bitcoin could drop 71% from its $12,800 high, reaching $4,500 before the next halving. It seemed rather unlikely at the time, but a six-month timeframe in cryptocurrency is a very long time.Hats off to Willy Woo on this call as the March 13 infamous crash caused a brief test of the $4,000 level. Despite being correct, buying protection for such a long time frame costs substantial money. A $6K put option would have cost Woo $540 back then.Notorious Bitcoin basher Peter Schiff spotted a head and shoulders pattern and issued a $1,000 prediction. Although no timeframe was set, based on such a pattern, a three-month time frame seems reasonable.One doesn't need to be a statistician to deem such predictions as unreasonable. According to the options model, a $5,000 target back would still have shown a limited 10.7% probability. Peter could have remained bearish using a more reasonable goal, according to options markets at that time. The 40-year market stalwart said that BTC had already hit its floor; hence investors waiting for a price dip to $6,000 have ""missed"" their opportunity. No timeline was mentioned, although a 3-month prediction would have pleased most investors.Less than two months after that tweet, the sudden Bitcoin collapse on March 13 proved Peter Brandt's prediction wrong.In an interview with Yahoo! Finance, Fundstrat senior analyst Tom Lee suggested that Bitcoin's technical achievements paved the way for 200% gains within six months, with halving acting as a catalyst.With less than 20 days to fulfill such a prediction, it seems very unlikely to occur. At least buying a $23K call option would have cost $65, a bargain considering a $4,000 upside to Lee's target.The creator of the stock-to-flow model revealed his belief that Bitcoin would not return below $8,200. PlanB also mentioned that he was expecting levels above $10,000 near Bitcoin halving in May.Less than a month later, PlanB's $8,200 support level was broken, although his $10,000 prediction for halving was pretty close as it was off by only 3% to 5%. One might say PlanB got it 50% right, although the bold $10,000 prediction could have earned him good money using a butterfly spread strategy.Black & Scholes can be a useful tool to understand how far a prediction might be from options pricing. What’s clear is that pundits seem to exaggerate their takes, which leads to huge misses and misinformation in the form of bad analysis being spread through major media outlets. In some cases, the wild guesses do hit the mark. For example, Willy Woo and PlanB could certainly have profited by defying options model pricing, but generally it's better to do your own research instead of following calls from ‘leading’ analysts. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk.

283,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight range has put analysts in a fix, meaning, every bit of data is being analyzed to determine the direction of the impending breakout. Bitcoin options open interest data can provide some clues on what the larger investors are expecting but there are many other factors at play that could influence Bitcoin’s spot price.Currently, the maximum open interest buildup in calls is at the $11,000 strike price and in puts at the $8,000 strike price. This suggests that the writers of these options do not believe that these levels are likely to be breached by expiry. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360The immediate support is at the $9,000 strike price where there is an open interest buildup of 2,042.4 put options. On the upside, the $9,500 strike price has open interest buildup of 1,056.3 call options. This suggests that the number of options buyers who believe that the price of top-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap will not break below $9,000 is more than traders who do not expect the price to rise above $9,500, which is a mild positive.BTC options data largely supports the view that the price could remain range-bound until the expiry. However, in case the price breaks out with force, options sellers will be forced to cover their positions and this could add fuel to Bitcoin’s price action.The range in Bitcoin (BTC) has tightened in the past few days, which suggests that both the bulls and the bears are waiting on the sidelines for a trending move to start before jumping in to initiate a position. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewWhile the range-bound action has been talked about for many days, the biggest question is which way the breakout will happen. The directional movement index (DMI) indicator can be used to identify whether the bulls or the bears have the upper hand.Along with it, the average directional movement index (ADX) can be used to see when the trend is likely to pick up steam.In the BTC/USD pair, history suggests that the ADX starts a strong trending move when it is close to 10.80 levels (marked as ellipses on the chart). Currently, the ADX is at 17.92, which suggests that the range-bound action might continue for a few more days and the ADX can drop further before the price breaks out decisively.The -DI (colored red) is currently dominant as it is on top and the +DI (colored green) is at the bottom, which suggests that the bears have a slight edge over the bulls. If the price breaks below the immediate support at $8,900 and the ADX pushes above 25, it will increase the possibility of a deeper pullback. If the price rises from the current levels and breaks above $9,500 with a rally that pushes the ADX above 25, it will signal the possibility of a sustained up-move.There are two critical things for traders to watch is the ADX level as it will indicate a possible sustained trend above 25 and the dominant DI.BTC/USD 4-hour chart.

284,"The decentralized finance sector has been steadily growing and has begun to see the fruits of its labor. But while there is much hype surrounding DeFi projects and applications, particularly during Bitcoin’s (BTC) uncharacteristic lack of volatility, there is still a long way to go. The technology is still in its early stages, yet even as issues of usability, scalability, interoperability and lack of regulatory clarity continue to exasperate the space, the promise of DeFi is undeniable, and its value is impossible to ignore.Thus far, 2020 hasn’t been the best of years for many, but DeFi has certainly come into its own by expanding exponentially. It passed a key milestone in February when the cumulative value of tokens locked in DeFi applications reached more than $1 billion. Despite some decline from a sell-off in March that spilled into all markets, that number already recovered by June. Today, it stands at $2.52 billion.Among some of the main protocols to drive this growth is decentralized oracle network Chainlink, whose token has exploded by over 1,000% this year. Lending protocols have also been seeing some of the most traction, with Compound accounting for 28% of the total locked value and MakerDAO following not far behind. The new phenomenon of “yield farming” has presented investors and crypto traders with opportunities to make gains.Yield farming, otherwise known as liquidity mining, is an important incentive mechanism that DeFi protocols use to attract liquidity. They do this by issuing governance tokens, such as Compound’s coin, COMP, that give governance rights to the holders who bring much-needed liquidity to the network.All this action has placed DeFi tokens among the best-performing crypto assets of this year. In addition to COMP’s staggering growth after entering the market and the unstoppable rise of Chainlink’s LINK, over the last 90 days, other DeFi tokens like Aave (LEND) and Bancor (BNT) have seen gains of well over 300%.No smart money can ignore stellar growth like this in the DeFi space, which is still largely dominated by retail investors. However, it has been gaining some serious traction among institutional investors — despite the infrastructure not being quite ready just yet. Let’s take a look at a few examples.According to a recent survey by Fidelity Asset Management, 80% of the surveyed institutions now find investing in digital assets appealing. That’s a sizable number and a gigantic shift compared to just a couple of years ago when many were brandishing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as scams.Yet beyond investing in well-known digital assets, some key traditional investment firms have redirected their interest toward DeFi to help the development of the space. The Chicago DeFi Alliance, for example, comprises some of the top trading, brokerage and investment firms. This initiative was created to support promising DeFi startups with finance, resources, market making and other services.We’re talking about behemoth players like TD Ameritrade, Arca and CMT Digital. All of the firms involved have been pushing for both the development of the space and its regulation. But while regulation remains decidedly unclear across this decentralized, multi-jurisdictional space, investors have been greatly encouraged by action from the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States regarding Arca’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange this month.A Bitcoin-ETF may continue to be a hot potato, but this July, the SEC approved an Ethereum-based fund. After nearly 20 months of pushing for the decision, Arca Labs started selling shares in its Arca U.S. Treasury Fund on July 6 after receiving an official “Notice of Effectiveness.”SEC-approved, Arca’s digital shares are represented by ArCoins and are traded on the Ethereum blockchain. This is a major milestone for the entire industry, as it represents the first time the SEC has allowed a fund comprising cryptographic tokens to enter the investment markets — and it is a huge step in the right direction toward unifying traditional finance with digital asset investment.While Bitcoin’s trading volume has hit a six-month low, interest from several key players continues to turn to Ethereum. The world’s largest crypto investment firm, Grayscale, recently announced that it was increasing its weighting of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) in its Digital Large-Cap investment fund.The fund’s major holding of course still remains Bitcoin by a country mile; between March and June, the percentage of BTC held in its fund increased from 81% to 81.5%. However, Ethereum’s weighting at Grayscale also increased significantly from 9.6% to 11.7% in Q2.All this institutional interest in Ether is extremely positive for the community ahead of Ethereum 2.0, and we are pleased to be at the forefront of the next big wave of crypto adoption that will eventually take real-world assets to the blockchain and finally allow the unbanked a chance at accessing financial services. Not only do we list major DeFi tokens including LINK, Maker (MKR) and COMP but we are also among the first validators on the Topaz testnet, Ethereum’s testnet for Ethereum 2.0.We are continually expanding our footprint in the DeFi space with customer-to-customer lending features, DeFi governance token listings and our own public chain, OKChain, allowing a host of DeFi apps to be built on a large commercial scale.We’re aware of the challenges surrounding the DeFi space and understand the strides that still have to be made. But the increased institutional interest in a still-nascent area is a good sign that DeFi will continue to expand, and OKEx is thrilled to be at the forefront of crypto’s next revolution.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Jay Hao is a tech veteran and seasoned industry leader. Prior to OKEx, he focused on blockchain-driven applications for live video streaming and mobile gaming.

285,"On July 11, fraudsters hacked into digital payment platform Cashaa’s over-the-counter desk, which serves Indian customers, and stole 336 Bitcoin (BTC), worth approximately $3.1million. Although Cashaa stated that there have been no users affected by this hack, they did put a hard stop on all crypto-related transactions for 24 hours to understand the incident better.Cashaa is a United Kingdom-based crypto-friendly bank that deals with Bitcoin OTC operations and works with major traditional and crypto exchanges in India. According to an official statement, the incident took place with an OTC transaction manager based in East Delhi, India, whose personal computer was attacked with malware. Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO of Cashaa, revealed to Cointelegraph more details on the underlying circumstances that led to this incident:“On 8th July 2020, the employee had reported a machine malfunction with the computer provided to him by the company. Hence, he requested to operate from his personal computer to set up multiple alternative online wallets on various platforms like Blockchain.com, Huobi etc. We made an exception and allowed him to do so, keeping ‘customer experience’ in mind for the ongoing OTC deals/transactions.”Cashaa presumes that malware was installed onto the employee’s personal computer, which was linked to a system enabling exchange transactions through the system. The targeted wallet was one that Cashaa used on Blockchain.com for Bitcoin transactions. Gaurav also added that following the mishap, the compromised device has been in the custody of the company’s investigation team with the employee being suspended until the end of the investigation. To further discussing the methods used to break into the Cashaa ecosystem, Gaurav revealed:“Hackers got the control of our employee’s computer with active sessions opened in the browser. The hackers used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks. We are still concluding all possible methods used.”The firm states that it has filed an incident report with the Cyber Crime division of the Delhi Crime Bureau. Cashaa even shared the Bitcoin wallet address of the hacker in a tweet, tagging all the major exchanges, namely WazirX, Binance, CoinDCX and Bitbns and urging them to monitor all transactions related to the address and other wallets that have transacted with it since the incident.Immediately after the incident, Cashaa called for a board meeting to decide if the company would be absorbing all the losses and how these incidents can be avoided in the future. Cointelegraph discussed the outcome of this board meeting with Gaurav, and he stated that an announcement will be made soon, adding: “This is a country-specific incident and hence the management of that subsidiary (Cashaa India OTC) will come up with some deliverables including standards of future operations, security and client relations.”It would be essential for the firm to account and absorb these losses within their ecosystem, as hacks like these usually remain unsolved. However, top executives from exchanges like ZebPay, WazirX, CoinDCX and Bitbns have shown their support for Cashaa on Twitter, assuring the company that they will take all the necessary precautions to ensure that they do not allow the movement of those funds if they can be traced. Gaurav acknowledged this support and commented further on the possibility of recovery referring to the Upbit hack: “All our partners and customers have joined together to give out a strong message to hackers that cashing out hacked Bitcoin is not going to be easy.” He went on to add that many exchanges have “blacklisted the hacker’s address.” Amid several Twitter allegations that this hack seemed like a fraudulent exit scam, which even raised questions about the company’s CAS currency, a source, who chose to remain anonymous, told Cointelegraph that it is believed the theft was an inside job done by a high-ranking executive of the bank. Cointelegraph discussed this possibility Daniel Worsley, a co-founder and the chief operating officer of LocalCoinSwap — a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace — who stated:“It is definitely plausible that this could be an inside hack. Cashaa will now begin an internal investigative process to try and determine how the malware ended up on the computer and who had access to the wallet that was breached.”It is also important to note that 336 BTC was stored in a hot wallet with no multi signatures, which seems highly odd for a firm with payments expertise. With more than a week passing after the hack and despite having the affected computer in its possession, Cashaa still hasn’t announced what caused the attack. Cointelegraph discussed more on the specifics with Sidharth Sogani, the founder and CEO of CREBACO — a crypto research and analytics firm — who revealed:“The funds were on a single signature legacy hot wallet, which is not apt for an exchange. The funds were moved to legacy wallets as well, usually planned hackers don’t use legacy anymore, they use bech32 as it’s faster, definitely the hack wasn’t don’t by a hacker, but someone naive on the tech.”Pointing out how the funds were stored was also a breach of common protocol, Sogain further stated: “As per CREBACO benchmarks, any digital assets exchange having more than 100 BTC must have an HSM in place to protect the funds.” When Cashaa commented on the possibility of this being an inside job, the company wasn’t able to commit with confidence that it wasn’t. Gaurav stated:“It does not seem like an Insider job. The investigating cybercrime company hasn’t given us a hint in that direction. Besides that, we cannot be sure of anything till the time those ‘hacked Bitcoins’ are encashed and the trail ends at an eventual beneficiary.”As this hack affected the India entity of Cashaa, where there are little or no regulations around cryptocurrencies, there is no regulatory body that can step in to resolve the issue and help in recovering the lost funds. Worsley opined on the matter:“I believe that regulation could help to reduce the risk of hacks like this. Alternatively, users can keep themselves safe by using decentralized exchanges where they are in control of their funds and private cryptographic keys throughout the trading and asset storage processes.”For a perspective on ecosystem security, Cointelegraph reached out to Javvad Malik, a security awareness advocate at KnowBe4 — a web security awareness training platform. By elaborating on the systems that crypto platforms could adopt from traditional banks, he said:“Even without regulations, though, cryptocurrency exchanges should look to implement stringent safeguards across processes, technologies and people to reduce the likelihood of fraud or theft. This would mean having controls similar to those of traditional banks, such as multi-factor authentication, segregation of duties, segregated systems and user awareness training, threat detection controls and response capabilities, to name a few.”Regardless of the regulatory situation, Worsley feels that this hack could have been avoided if Cashaa wasn’t using Blockchain.com’s wallet — a third-party wallet — to manage its funds. He further commented: “Many of the most reputable exchanges utilize hardware wallets or hardware security modules to store and handle the crypto assets under management. Although no system is 100% secure, one set up like this would be much harder to breach.”Insider job or not, such hacks in the crypto industry do not bode well for the overall reputation of the sector in the minds of investors and governing bodies alike. Especially in a country like India, regulators have only started to understand the nuances of crypto and blockchain technologies."
286,"Chainlink’s token, LINK, is once again among the most talked-about altcoins, having surged over 370% year-to-date. In July alone, the now ninth-largest crypto by market cap has gained close to 80%, with blockchain analytics firm Santiment identifying LINK as its top-ranked emerging cryptocurrency.Amid the price gains for LINK has come talk of a new altseason, especially for altcoins related to the currently booming decentralized finance market. As the DeFi market continues to experience significant growth, the need for decentralized oracles for smart contract protocols, like the type offered by Chainlink, becomes even more important.On the opposite side of the conversation, critics argue that LINK’s price surge is only a speculative bubble driven by fear of missing out. Despite the growing utility for Chainlink’s oracle solutions, some pundits point to DeFi protocols developing their own in-house oracles as being the death knell for Chainlink utility.With Bitcoin (BTC) continuing on its range-bound trajectory, some commentators say altcoin tokens might be primed to deliver significant gains. Since peaking at 67% in mid-May, BTC has seen its market capitalization dominance dip slightly, owing to the price gains experienced by several major altcoin tokens.A blockchain as a self-contained network should, in theory, offer robust immutability, which makes data manipulation difficult. To alter records stored in a decentralized ledger, a rogue actor would need a large amount of computing power. Since the novel tech emerged with the creation of Bitcoin over a decade ago, several other networks have come online offering different functionalities. Nowadays, it is common to see organizations, and even governments, talk about creating blockchain-based solutions for their operations.Whether these blockchains have any technical merit is a discussion for another time. Assuming they do, their implied decentralization only exists within their network boundaries in isolation. Any interaction with data from another blockchain or “real-world” service often requires a centralized “middleware.” Tainted data from these third-party sources effectively nullifies the fidelity of the blockchain’s data.Thus, the idea of centralized oracles does not tally with the decentralized ethos of blockchain functionality. Oracles are intermediaries that translate data from off-chain sources to on-chain smart contracts and vice versa.Chainlink is one of such projects that facilitates the secure and trustworthy decentralization of oracles via a network of nodes tasked with providing accurate information for on-chain smart contracts. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle consists of data purchasers and provides the former with requesting information and the latter acting as providers of secure data. Instead of communicating with centralized services for outside data, blockchain networks need only interact with Chainlink oracles. Providers stake LINK — the native token of the Chainlink network — to bid on information requests made by purchasers.When a data purchaser submits a query for something like the weather forecast, for example, the Chainlink protocol registers this query as an “event,” creating a service level agreement. The SLA proceeds via three basic sub-smart contracts: a reputation contract, an order-matching contract and an aggregating contract.The reputation contract tracks oracle metrics, while the order-matching contract examines the bids from participant nodes based on the parameters defined by the data purchaser. In the final step of the SLA, the aggregation contract collates the information provided by the nodes to determine which is best suited to satisfy the event. Thus, the aggregation contract involves three major steps — selecting the best oracle, reporting the data and result collation. Data from the aggregation contract also provides updated oracle metrics for future queries.Back in mid-June, Cointelegraph reported that Chainlink price oracles were dominating the DeFi space with protocols like Kyber Network integrating Chainlink price data into its token swap market. For an emerging crypto market sector like DeFi, Chainlink should, in theory, offer enhanced connectivity, trusted price data, increased computational ability and robust privacy. Given the broad applicability of the DeFi sector, decentralized oracle services are a must-have with some projects having already developed their own in-house solutions.Indeed, access to secure and trusted off-chain data is often the bane of many decentralized applications. DeFi applications can hardly function on data available on their native chains alone and often require access to enterprise systems, web APIs and payment systems, among others. DeFi protocols work by way of smart contract execution whose settlement depends largely on several types of off-chain data. Chainlink oracles provide access to these enterprise backend systems to help run the DeFi projects.By interfacing with several DeFi protocols, oracle networks like Chainlink can also deliver customized data sets like aggregated price indices for major cryptos like BTC, Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT). Instead of DeFi lending or a money market creating and maintaining price feeds that require constant updates, protocols can interface with these decentralized price oracles.Data computation is also another problem for DeFi protocols and DApps, in general. Any process that requires input from two or more nodes or oracles means multiple gas fees that will negatively impact the network’s practicality. Decentralized oracle networks like Chainlink should, in theory, offer low-cost data computation via pathways like threshold signatures, which should limit the gas cost for transactions. Part of this low-cost data computation occurs off-chain within trusted hardware that allows nodes to operate in a “black box ecosystem.” Reducing the volume of on-chain transactions while still maintaining security protocols is one of the ways of boosting blockchain scalability.On the privacy side of things, Chainlink offers solutions like “mixicles,” an oracle mixer that eliminates the correlation between smart contract inputs and outputs. This process makes it difficult for any on-chain observer to match the settlement of a smart contract to its input. Mixicles can provide the necessary privacy to protect things like trading strategies, internal positions, etc., from rogue actors looking to steal such data. The system works similarly to mixers for cryptocurrency payments.The 80% increase in LINK’s price in July alone has seen Chainlink’s native token become the ninth-ranked crypto by market capitalization. But as is often the case, a surge usually has observers debating whether the current price action is FOMO-driven. For Konstantin Anissimov, the executive director at crypto exchange CEX.IO, LINK’s upward push is a result of initial retail interest front running the market followed by whales looking to profit off the token. Anissimov pointed out to Cointelegraph that the 200% hike in Chainlink network activity occurred as soon as the token recovered from its mid-March slump:“Once the decentralized oracle’s token began reaching higher highs, investors rushed to exchanges to get a piece of the price action. On July 13th, however, there was a substantial spike in the number of large LINK transactions, which suggests that at this point whales entered the market. Approximately 300 large transactions were registered on this day alone, representing a 1,011% increase from July 11th. It seems like whales were able to give Chainlink the last push from $6 to nearly $9.”Indeed, as previously identified, three on-chain metrics, including significant growth in the number of active addresses, explain the positive price action for LINK. Back in June, China’s Blockchain Service Network integrated with the project and is reportedly running over 135 nodes.However, some critics say the meteoric rise in LINK’s price is not due to the growing utility for the altcoin token. In a now-deleted document, little known asset management firm Zeus Capital classified the recent gains as being the result of an elaborate pump-and-dump scheme by Chainlink.Amid the litany of fraudulent activities ascribed to the Chainlink hierarchy in the 66-page document, the purported asset management firm described the project as being “crypto’s Wirecard.” However, it is important to note that Zeus Capital is reportedly holding a short position with a target of a 99% price decline for LINK.According to a tweet by TheLinkMarine — a Chainlink proponent — the Zeus Capital report allegedly leads to an executive at lending protocol Nexo. Meanwhile, Nexo borrowed 350,000 LINK from DeFi lending market Aave only two days before the document was published. This purported link between the publisher of the document and Nexo does call the veracity of the claims made in the report into question. Excerpts from the piece seen by Cointelegraph before its removal urged readers to short LINK on Aave. Short sellers disparaging Chainlink aside, there are indications that LINK could be seeing a significant downward retracement. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Thor Chan, the CEO of AAX — a crypto exchange — opined: “Looking closely at LINK/USD price charts, we can see that the RSI has hit the overbought level, and historically, with LINK, that has led to some steep price drops.” Anissimov also shared a similar sentiment, stating that LINK has entered the overbought zone, adding that:“Different sell signals are popping up within different time frames, such as the 3-day, 1-day, and 12-hour charts. These bearish formations indicate that Chainlink could be bound for a bearish impulse. However, LINK is currently in price discovery mode, so a corrective period that could see it retest the $5 support level, it will likely resume its uptrend and reach new all-time highs.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, LINK and Tezos (XTZ) often move in tandem. In July, XTZ also mirrored LINK’s gains, having risen 35% since the start of the month. With alts like XTZ and Cardano (ADA) experiencing significant uptrends, talk of another altseason has been gaining some traction. Related: Cardano’s ADA Price Continues Upward Push as Goguen Upgrade ApproachesHowever, Anissimov pointed to the relatively high BTC dominance as an argument against the start of any sustained altcoin resurgence, stating that only when BTC falls below 60%, he will acknowledge the start of an altcoin season: “During the last altseason, BTC’s dominance plunged from 95% to 61.5% within a two-month period between March and May 2017, then it dropped to 50% two months later, and bottomed out at 35% in January 2018.” While Bitcoin remains tightly range-bound between the $9,000 and $9,200 price levels, altcoins like LINK, XTZ and ADA can see significant upward potential, as investors look for a quick profit. However, the FOMO created by such sudden bullish advances often sees these altcoin tokens quickly enter massively overbought levels. At such points, these tokens become likely to see a bearish divergence form between their spot price action and relative strength index. What follows next is often a massive downward retrace almost as large as the preceding bullish advance."
287,"In July 2017, John McAfee said he would “eat his own dick” if Bitcoin does not hit $500,000 within three years. Today, BTC is hovering at a mere $9,130 and its price must increase by more than 5,376% to meet McAfee’s prediction.John McAfee tweets he would eat his dick if Bitcoin doesn’t hit $500k. Source: John McAfee TwitterIn general, Bitcoin quite clearly got nowhere near $500,000 in the past three years. Not only that, but McAfee is also seemingly backtracking from his $1 million per BTC prediction.Last year, McAfee said he is positive Bitcoin goes to $1 million. He said negativity around the cryptocurrency market was overblown, especially considering Bitcoin was in the mid-$10,000s.But on July 19, 2020, McAfee said:“Not going to get out of it. I never believed Bitcoin would hit $1 mil. It's absurd. It’s an old, tired, worthless coin. I just wanted to eat my dick on TV. Wait for it.”Since mid-2019, the price of Bitcoin dropped from around $13,900 to $9,100. Following the 34% drop in a 12-month period, McAfee no longer feels confident about his $1 million BTC prediction.In July 2019, McAfee said:“Bitcoin is at the mid 10's and people worry. LMFAO!! Why do you pay attention to weekly fluctuations? Look at the past few months FFS! It's rising drastically. I'm still positive about my $1 mil BTC price by the end of 2020. Alt coins like MTC and Apollo will rise ten times more.”Contrary to expectations, it also seems McAfee was referring to the end of 2020 as the prediction date for $500,000 per Bitcoin. When several cryptocurrency enthusiasts questioned him about the subject, McAfee cited a website called dickening.com. The website says McAfee “promised to eat his own dick” if BTC does not hit $1 million by December 31, 2020.McAfee said that it is “well documented” his bet was for Dec. 31 of this year, not July 2020. When asked about the bet, he reaffirmed that he would follow through with his bet if BTC does not hit $500,000.He said:“It's well documented that I will eat my dick on Dec 31st 2020, not in July of this year. Google the bet. The ‘In three years’ was a reference to that date. The originator of this tweet did not research it. Will I eat it? You bet! Myself, or, perhaps, a subcontractor:)”Max Keiser, the host of The Keiser Report and Bitcoin investor, sarcastically said McAfee must now be recovering at the hospital after honoring the bet.“John McAfee honored his bet, made three years ago, to bite off his dick if Bitcoin wasn’t at $500,000 GOOD NEWS: He’s doing well at the hospital and expected to make a full recovery,” Keiser said.Of course, McAfee’s track record shows that his predictions should be taken with a grain of salt. For instance, his facetious U.S. Presidential campaign now appears to be inactive. Then in May 2020, McAfee questioned his own price prediction, leaving many confused.Nevertheless, for McAfee to win the bet, BTC price would now have to gain at least 10,000% over the next five months."
288,"Bill Barhydt, CEO and founder of the Abra digital finance wallet and exchange app, said he sees Bitcoin’s (BTC) blockchain struggling when it comes to on-chain mass adoption of the asset as a store of value, given the asset’s current technology. “Bitcoin can certainly scale ‘off-chain’ today via third-party custodians such as exchanges and wallets like Abra or other so-called second-layer technologies such as Lightning,” Barhydt told Cointelegraph on July 15.  He added:“When held in that manner Bitcoin’s scalability is probably limitless. However, Bitcoin doesn’t yet have the scalability it needs to be held by billions of people as a store of value on-chain.”Previous reporting revealed Barhydt’s view of Bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold, traveling an increasingly uncorrelated price path compared to mainstream markets. Gaining mass adoption as a global store of value, however, obviously requires the ability to handle high traffic.Through the years, a number of industry participants have proposed larger block sizes to combat transaction speed difficulties. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) notably forked off from BTC in 2017, debating larger block sizes as the answer, while other camps looked toward second-layer solutions, such as the Lightning Network, as a solution. Barhydt’s comments show his confidence in second-layer solutions, although he did mention larger blocks for Bitcoin on-chain scaling. “To scale on chain to billions of people, new technologies will be required as well as dramatically increased block sizes,” he said. “It’s possible that Bitcoin only scales off-chain to meet the needs of the masses in the future,” he noted, adding, “Time will tell.”With over 100 different crypto assets on its platform, Abra hosts compatibility for multiple blockchains. “The digital assets held in Abra’s system today are 100% native,” Barhydt explained. “They use whatever platform each individual digital asset was built on across all hundred or so digital assets our Abra app supports,” he added, noting the presence of third-party asset custody coordinated in conjunction with the app.Going forward, after a $5 million investment from the Stellar Development Foundation, or SDF, in May 2020, Abra now has its sights on also offering conventional banking features constructed on Stellar’s blockchain, Barhydt explained."
289,"As reports hit the United Kingdom in mid-June warning that inflation rates had fallen to a four-year low, high-profile fund managers were conversely worrying that the COVID-19 stimulus from governments and central banks would ultimately drive up prices. In a recent market outlook note, famed hedge fund investor Paul Tudor Jones warned that: “We are witnessing the ‘great monetary inflation’ — an unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen. High debt accommodated by money printing is difficult to banish. Inflation expectations could one day respond to this reality.” Crispin Odey, the London-based founder of Odey Asset Management, also agrees inflation is ultimately unavoidable given the level of stimulus. “In the short term, the money will be made on the inflation bet,“ Odey wrote in a recent letter. With potential inflation seemingly on the horizon, investors are looking out for the next big hedge in order to protect assets during the nascent economic crisis.Jones, for one, has decided a way forward is to invest his fund, Tudor Investment Corporation, into Bitcoin (BTC). “If I am forced to forecast, my bet is it will be Bitcoin,” commented Jones in the same letter to investors. “Bitcoin reminds me of gold when I first got into the business in 1976.” After the United States Federal Reserve indicated on June 10 that interest rates will remain near 0% until 2022, Bitcoin saw a short-lived run past $10,000, gaining 1.6% over 24 hours before dropping back.Institutional investment managers have been increasingly interested in all things crypto over the past couple of years, and their interest keeps rising. A recent Fidelity report shows that in a survey of almost 800 institutional investors across the U.S. and Europe, 45% of firms in Europe say they hold crypto assets. Fidelity goes on to report: “The survey revealed higher penetration with crypto hedge and venture funds, as expected, but also the financial advisor, high net worth individual and family office segments.” Consumers are also showing increased signs of interest, with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority reporting that an estimated 2.6 million people have bought crypto assets at some point, nearly double the number reported last year. Investors across the board can take advantage of these same trends and realize the benefits of hedging against inflation via Bitcoin. But accessing crypto markets can be extremely convoluted at times, with crypto exchanges charging users hefty fees for the privilege. Yet over the past couple of years, there has been somewhat of a maturing of crypto markets. Now, more consumer-friendly, easy-to-use platforms have been set up, providing immediate and safe access to best-price crypto. Users of these platforms can benefit by instantaneously and effortlessly exchanging their money into digital currencies at competitive prices and monitoring their balances in real time. Through these unprecedented times as economies around the world adjust to dealing with a pandemic, investors across the globe are having to readjust their positions. Using Bitcoin to hedge against potential inflation is not solely in the realm of the Joneses and Odeys of this world, however. New technology platforms are making it much easier for U.K residents to similarly safeguard their assets by combining currencies into one account, helping to make cryptocurrencies more readily available.“The best profit-maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse,” Jones said in his “Great Monetary Inflation” note. He clearly believes that Bitcoin is the one to back.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Mark Hipperson is the founder and CEO of Ziglu, a cryptocurrency trading platform.

290,"Not a day goes by without someone shilling something related to Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It’s being touted as being bigger than the 2017 altcoin boom, and when you look at things like the monstrous Tether market cap, the recent surge in the price of Chainlink as well as DeFi platform Celsius recently exceeding $1 billion in crypto deposits, it's clear that these are well-founded claims.  However, the one problem that this potentially presents for Bitcoin is the value proposition to high-net-worth-individuals and institutions considering entering the space. Earn as much as 8% interest on USDT in a year or risk losing 11% on Bitcoin in a day?    Daily crypto market performance. Source: Coin360.comBTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView Using the 1-day BTC chart, it’s clear that we’re still in a descending pattern dangerously close to the top of a channel.  The current price is about $9,150 and the resistance is at $9,270. This puts the mid-level support at $8,750 and the lower channel support at $8,200, which suggests to potential Bitcoin buyers that an 11% drop to the channel support is a potential scenario. I don’t know about you, but when faced with potentially losing 11% in a day, compared to earning 8% in a year on a DeFi platform, the risk vs. reward, especially for institutions managing third-party portfolios, the latter certainly looks like the safest bet.       But what about the same view on the world's number-two coin by market capitalization, namely Ether? Its Ethereum blockchain hosts many of these so-called DeFi projects that have been gaining a lot of attention lately.ETH/USD 1-Day chart. Source: TradingView Comparatively, Ether (ETH) looks like it is trading at the bottom of its current ascending channel on the daily chart. In other words, it paints a picture of a 50% upside and a 3% downside.  While this is only one view, and by no means a guarantee of what will happen in the immediate future, it signals to me that Etheruem’s Ether token could potentially be staging its comeback.  Despite all the FUD and controversy, you can also read on Twitter about Ethereum 2.0 delays and one of its co-founders wishing to be disassociated with it. However, you cannot deny that Ethereum has cemented itself as being equally important as Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency space.Without Ethereum, you wouldn’t have the majority of DeFi platforms, smart contracts, or altcoins that might give you insane returns if you pick the right one, including the marines’ beloved Chainlink (LINK).ETH/USD 1-week chart Source: TradingViewIn last week's technical analysis, I looked at the fib on Bitcoin. Not much has changed in the price of Bitcoin since with it still hovering around the 0.382 fib.  However, for Ether, all of the price action in its current channel occurs below 0.236, which would put ETH/USD close to $400 should it reach the first Fibonacci level.  What’s more, that doesn’t even bring Ether price close to Bitcoin’s current retracement levels. If ETH were to approach the 0.382 fib, we’re looking at a 150% gain on the second-largest cryptocurrency in the space.  The question is then, will Ethereum begin to outperform Bitcoin in the immediate future?   If so, what will happen to all of the alts paired with ETH and subsequent profits people start taking on ETH only pairs? What effect would you expect to happen across the space? It seems it would be 2017 all over again while also presenting a third option attractive for investors. Bitcoin has long been touted as a safe-haven asset and store-of-value. But DeFi presents alternative investment opportunities, and while perhaps a token like Chainlink could lead the next bull run, don’t forget that paired assets are the ships that will rise with the tide, which puts Ether in prime position for a comeback.BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView Looking at Bitcoin on the hourly chart, it’s important for Bitcoin bulls to break past the 0.618 fib of $9,300 to break out of the current downward slide.  The price was rejected off the 0.382 of $9,200 in the last 24 hours, so right now all eyes are firmly on this tight range.Once out of this range, breaking out of the current fib pattern of $9,500 would be key to once again see the multi-year resistance $10,500 being challenged again. I see a lot of support around $8,900 on the daily chart. From here, it begins to open up $7,800 as the next potential Fibonacci target for support.BTC/USD 1-daily chart.

291,"Two alleged criminals, one suspected of stealing thousands of Bitcoin and the other a money launderer with connections to Hezbollah, were extradited from Cyprus, according to the Department of Justice or DOJ.One of the suspects is wanted in Georgia and Arizona for cyber intrusion and extortion and the other is wanted in Florida for money-laundering in support of Hezbollah. Joshua Polloso Epifaniou, a Cypriot national, is accused of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and identity theft and extortion. The DOJ said Epifaniou and conspirators stole personal information from an online game publisher in California, a hardware company in New York, an online employment website in Virginia and an online sports website owned by Turner Broadcasting System from October November 2014 until 2016. He allegedly hacked into the networks and defrauded them of $56,850 in Bitcoin.Epifaniou is also alleged to have organized a brute force attack on Ripoff Report in 2016 where he held its database under ransom for $90,000.The second man extradited by the DOJ is Ghassan Diab, a citizen of Lebanon accused of money laundering over $100,000, conspiracy to launder of $100,000 and unlicensed transmission of currency.

292,"Canadian regulator Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has accused embattled exchange Coinsquare of market manipulation and misleading clients about trading volumes.The OSC alleged Coinsquare, which has been accused of wash-trading and reports of a hack, had “engaged in conduct contrary to Ontario security laws.” The regulator also named founder Virgile Rostand, CEO Cole Diamond and chief compliance officer Felix Mazer as respondents. A hearing regarding the case will be held on July 21.  In its complaint, the OSC said Diamond directed Rostand to inflate trading numbers in March 2018. Rostand then came up with a solution that allowed the exchange to begin “wash” trading. Wash trading refers to artificially inflating trading volumes by executing large market trades into their own orders so it seems like large transactions occurred but no assets changed hands. Between July 17, 2018 and Dec. 4, 2019, Coinsquare did about 840,000 wash trades with an aggregate value of around 590,000 Bitcoins, the OSC said. These represented over 90% of trading volume on the exchange. Despite concerns from staff, Coinsquare continued its wash-trading activities and thus manipulated the market and consumers, said the OSC. The regulator requested information on the exchange’s trading activity but Coinsquare did not report any irregularities and said it is “taking steps to prevent market manipulation and highlighted controls it claimed could help detect such conduct.”The OSC also said Coinsquare terminated an internal whistleblower after the employee raised concerns about the wash trading. Reddit users became suspicious of Coinsquare’s activity in two different instances. Vice also reported on leaked documents that showed Diamond ordering the wash trading."
293,"It has been all over the news about the great Twitter Bitcoin hack of 2020. We’ve got you covered if you haven’t been paying attention to #CryptoTwitter this week.After a period of calm in the cryptomarkets, last week showed some movement. Unfortunately, it went in the wrong direction. Bitcoin was down about 3 percent over the last seven days—and it got off lightly. Ethereum fell more than 5 percent and Bitcoin Cash dropped over 8 percent.One reason for the fall might be a relationship between stocks and digital coins. Analysts note that Bitcoin shows a 95 percent correlation with the S&P 500, and the Fear and Greed Index suggests that greed is moving the stock market while fear is holding onto cryptocurrencies.There has been plenty of movement and in different directions: Tesla stock is rocketing even as Bitcoin volatility hits a three-year low. Binance coin has risen 17 percent. Other analysts suggest that a “crypto winter” could be over as take-up of digital coins increases, especially those with proof-of-stake protocols, but the data says that people are holding onto Bitcoin but trading Ether.People should certainly be holding tightly onto their Bitcoins when they’re using Twitter. A massive hack of the social media platform placed scam messages on the accounts of Elon Musk, Kanye West, Bill Gates, and Joe Biden among others. The messages asked for donations of Bitcoin and promised a 2:1 return. Reports suggest that victims sent around $118,000 worth of Bitcoin to the address in the posts.One set of transactions, though, contained a hidden message apparently suggesting that the scammers use Monero instead of Bitcoin. The hackers appear to be associated with the now-defunct website CryptoforHealth.com but we still don’t know who was behind it. Justin Sun wants to find out. His was one of the accounts hacked. He’s offering a million dollars to anyone who can help track them down.He probably shouldn’t give that million dollars to Joshua Thomas Argires though. The 29-year-old Texan is alleged to have filed false loan applications worth $1.1 million to the Covid-19 Paycheck Protection Program. He then used the funds to buy cryptocurrency. Argires has been charged but he should count himself lucky.The bodies of two promoters of the OneCoin scam have been found in suitcases in Mexico. The men, Oscar Brito Ibarra and Ignacio Ibarra, had been kidnapped and suffocated to death.While Joe Biden scratches his head over the Bitcoin Twitter hack, Ron Paul’s political director is quietly mining Bitcoin and building a new blockchain company.

294,"During a recent YouTube livestream, Morgan Creek Digital co-founder and crypto expert Anthony Pompliano detailed the current post-COIVD-19 economy, noting the U.S. government's money printing and spending efforts.   ""There is a devaluation of currency,"" Pomliano said in his July 18 livestream. ""The whole secret to building wealth is to get out of cash and get into assets that are denominated in dollars that will continue to go up in value over long periods of time — stocks, real estate, gold, Bitcoin, all this stuff.""COVID-19 prevention measures have caused economic stalling and job losses. As part of corrective measures, the U.S. government has pumped money into the country, printing and giving away money, as detailed by Pomliano. U.S. corporations and billionaires have reaped the benefits, receiving mass bailouts, he explained. ""You have to get out of cash,"" Pompliano said, urging people to flee into other assets. ""Don't fight the Fed,"" he noted, referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve. Pompliano added:The past half a century reveals large-scale inflation in the U.S. as seen when compared to gold. A chart of the stock market showing the past several decades of price action reveals a 45-degree angle upward, meaning markets have essentially risen significantly over time when valued in dollars, Pompliano explained. ""Structurally, stock prices are going up over long periods of time with nothing to do with the underlying companies,"" he said. ""It has everything to do with the fact that the dollar, the denominator, the thing that the asset is denominated in, is being devalued.""When valued in gold instead of dollars, however, the same stock market chart shows a declining trend over the last 49 years or so, revealing a devalued dollar instead of higher valued stocks, said Pomp.Among the assets Pompliano mentioned, Bitcoin in particular, by nature, holds inflation protection against itself. Only 21 million Bitcoin (BTC) will ever exist, based on the asset's original code. As world governments print increasing amounts of paper money, Bitcoin's supply remains constant, making it a type of hedge.Pompliano has also argued Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset on many occasions, positing the digital asset journeys a price path independent of traditional markets.

295,"Twitter vows to add more security training and measures as the fallout from Wednesday’s wide-scale hack on the social platform continues. Twitter said in a statement that it is continuing its investigation into the hack while it looks to provide more company-wide security training against social engineering tactics. This will be in addition to cybersecurity coaching they get during onboarding and ongoing phishing exercises. About 130 accounts were compromised on Wednesday when hackers took over prominent Twitter accounts in a Bitcoin hoax. Those compromised included Elon Musk, Kanye West,  Bill Gates, former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden, as well as several crypto firms like Binance, Coinbase, BitFinex and Gemini.  “We’re acutely aware of our responsibilities to the people who use our service and to society more generally. We’re embarrassed, we’re disappointed, and more than anything, we’re sorry,” Twitter said. “We know that we must work to regain your trust, and we will support all efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. We hope that our openness and transparency throughout this process, and the steps and work we will take to safeguard against other attacks in the future, will be the start of making this right.”Twitter said the hackers were able to view personal information like email addresses and phone numbers although the social media platform noted previous account passwords were not accessed. Additional information from accounts taken over by the hackers may have been viewed as well.The attackers targeted employees, Twitter said, using schemes intentionally manipulating them to perform certain actions and divulging confidential information. Hackers used Twitter employees’ credentials to access internal systems which is why even accounts with two-factor protections were compromised. This affected only 130 accounts but hackers changed passwords to 45 of those accounts. Some usernames may have been sold.A report from The New York Times said the hackers were a group of young people and they had planned the attack in a Discord server. Forensic investigation into the hack continues, Twitter said, and the company is fully cooperating with law enforcement. Cointelegraph reported Twitter had been looking for senior security engineers before the breach. The great hack has been deemed a wake-up call for centralized platforms. Some users even found hidden messages in some transactions. These transactions lead to wallets associated with Coinbase and BitPay."
296,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for everyone, but it has created many opportunities for us in the blockchain industry. In most industries, sales vectors are declining, as bankruptcies and layoffs rule the day. But companies in the crypto and blockchain space have been expanding, hiring and applying for new licenses. The pandemic has caused suffering in this industry, as in others, but the fundamentals of crypto are better than those of traditional financial markets. We will experience some reshuffling, but the crypto and blockchain industry will become stronger through this crisis. Newmarket participants are looking for derivative and margin products, and they’re increasingly looking to trade on their phones and mobile applications. The next wave of COVID-19 would eviscerate new, underdeveloped companies. That’s why sustainability is very important. Soon, there will be a crash test not just for crypto players but for everyone. Those efficient companies will persist, however, and the industry may become stronger for it. Traditional investors fear whether a second wave will again plunge the traditional market into turmoil. In March, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price fell to approximately $3,000 and promptly rebounded to over $9,000, even briefly hitting $10,000. By regaining its pre-pandemic level, we see how Bitcoin bounced back a lot faster than other financial investments. I anticipate crypto prices to collapse and quickly rebound in the event of a second wave of COVID-19.Crypto will continue to grow strong despite a global economic recession though many still suffer from COVID-19 and the effects of lockdown. In a global economic recession, individuals and institutions have been turning away from traditional assets and have been seeking opportunities in cryptocurrency.Therefore, traditional investors will continue to turn toward crypto assets, especially family offices and asset management companies. The market will only mature, particularly initial exchange offerings, decentralized finance and traditional financial markets. We see traditional investors becoming more aggressive when investing in this space, as well as building incubators for blockchain projects. Multinational companies and even banks have set up new investment arms for blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, looking to diversify into these alternative assets. According to a recent Fidelity survey, 80% of institutional investors found digital assets appealing, while 60% of them have been proactively looking at Bitcoin as part of their usual portfolio investment. In the survey, 74% of United States institutional investors and 82% of European investors saw cryptocurrency as appealing. Meanwhile, 36% of institutional respondents were attracted to cryptocurrency because it is “uncorrelated to other asset classes,” and 34% were attracted by the innovative nature of the technology. And 33% liked the high upside potential. Commenting on the survey, Tom Jessop, the president of Fidelity Digital Assets, said: “These results confirm a trend we are seeing in the market towards greater interest in and acceptance of digital assets as a new investable asset class.” He also added:“This is evident in the evolving composition of our client pipeline, which spans from crypto native funds to pensions.”The shift of offline business and physical activities to an online setting to crypto and blockchain startups. From here on out, we will see discussions and debates over cryptocurrency investment from billionaires and traditional investors. Whether they support it or not, they will keep a closer eye on crypto and blockchain technology. In the “new normal,” blockchain technology can be applied to the Internet of Things, medical systems, supply chains, and can be used for transparency in financial markets, charity and nongovernmental organizations. In Asian countries, for instance, little is known about how NGOs spend their money, and how many middlemen take a cut.

If this process is put on a blockchain, then everything is on-chain and transparent. There is no black box, and we can track donations to ensure that they are going where they were initially intended to go. After companies adopt blockchain technology for these purposes, only then will they begin to discuss tokenization. For now, to be certain, most of the attention remains on Bitcoin. In a post-COVID-19 world, diversifying portfolios will become increasingly important, especially for asset management companies and banks. COVID-19, therefore, is an opportunity for crypto to penetrate new markets, to work with big banks and to attract mainstream investors.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Kiana Shek is the chief experience officer of DigiFinex.

297,"Murphy’s law states: “Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.” It always happens with centralized services. A year ago, we saw how half a million Facebook accounts were leaked online, exposing personal data. We will see it many times more with other services. The recent Twitter hack underscores this once again. The accounts of Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Mike Bloomberg, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, among others, were hacked to push a fraudulent offer with Bitcoin (BTC).Writing for the BBC, cybersecurity commentator Joe Tidy opined: “The fact that so many different users have been compromised at the same time implies that this is a problem with Twitter’s platform itself.” All accounts were vulnerable; it was just a matter of choice for the hackers: Using celebrities is better to “endorse” scams.The problem is that even if Twitter or any other service with similar architecture continues building the cybersecurity walls around its system, it will become more complicated and expensive, but not safer. The current paradigm of centralized services cannot offer a safer solution for users’ authentication.I have recently written about new technologies that could protect data and digital identity, using the example of Australia and the European experience and how public key certificates could be protected with blockchain technology against distributed denial-of-service and man-in-the-middle attacks. Although my analysis was quite technical and thorough, perhaps it would be better to take a step back and comb through some general yet pertinent details that may enhance data protection.Here is some terminology for you to use when asking your service provider, your online store or your government about whether they are protecting your personal data:To put things into perspective, let’s go through a hypothetical situation.Alice generates her cryptographic pair: a private and public key. The private key encrypts transactions, using a digital signature; the public key decrypts them. The public key is used to verify whether Alice signed in, signed the contract, signed the blockchain transaction, etc.To protect the private key, she will store it on a secure hardware device with PIN protection, for instance, on a smart card, a USB authentication token or a hardware cryptocurrency wallet. Nevertheless, a cryptocurrency address is a representation of a public key, meaning Alice can use it as her coin and token wallet.Although the public key is anonymous, she can also create a verified digital identity. She can ask Bob to certify her identity. Bob is a certificate authority. Alice will visit Bob and show her ID. Bob will create a certificate and publish it on a blockchain. “Certificate” is a file that announces to the general public: “Alice’s public key is valid.” Bob will not publish it on his server the same way other traditional certificate authorities do now. If a centralized server were ever disabled in a DDoS attack, no one would be able to confirm whether Alice’s digital identity is valid or not. In the MITM attack someone can fake her identity. This would be impossible if the certificate or at least its hash sum were published on-chain.With a verified ID, she can perform official transactions, for example, registering a company. If Alice is an entrepreneur, she may want to publish her contacts, such as a telephone number. Using a blockchain is a safer choice because when data is published on social media, a hacker can break into an account and replace it to redirect calls to another number. None of this would be possible on a blockchain.If Alice goes to a liquor store, she can use her verified DID. The seller, Dave, will use his app to verify and confirm Alice’s DID instead of her paper ID. Alice does not need to disclose her name and date of birth. She will share with Dave’s app her identifier, which Bob certified, her picture and an “Above 21 y.o.” statement. Dave trusts this record because Bob is a certificate authority.Alice can create various pseudonyms for online shopping, social media and crypto exchanges. If she loses her private key, she will ask Bob to update his record on the blockchain to announce that “Alice’s public key is invalid.” Therefore, if someone stole it, everyone who interacts with her public key will know that they should not believe transactions signed with this key.Of course, this is a simplified scenario, but it is not unrealistic. Moreover, some of these processes already exist. For example, the Estonian e-Residency card is nothing more than a smart card with the user’s private key. With this card, you can remotely register a company in Estonia or even sign contracts. Being integrated into a larger market, Estonian digital signatures are recognized across the European Union. Unfortunately, its governments still do not protect certificates on blockchains.Knowledge is power. Users should know that their cybersecurity is not only in their hands, as one might say. Software and social media giants ought to make the shift to improve security standards, and users ought to demand it.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Oleksii Konashevych is the author of the Cross-Blockchain Protocol for Government Databases: The Technology for Public Registries and Smart Laws.

298,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been continuing the previous week’s weakness as the support of $9,000 has been tested many times. However, the market itself is not acting bearish because altcoins such as DOGE, for example, are surging left and right. Is the market ready for a momentum shift and a big volatile move by BTC, the top-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization?  Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360The price of Bitcoin is still resting at a significant level of support as there is a stalemate in place between the bulls and bears.As Bitcoin’s price has been consolidating, there’s an argument to be made that the price is making constant higher lows since March 12. The most recent low is the area between $8,700-8,900. That’s the bullish case.However, the price has been dropping since the peak high at $10,300 and has been making lower highs since. That leads to the overall conflict in the markets as both bullish and bearish arguments exist.BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin price is currently above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs), as the chart shows. At the same time, the crucial support level of $8,700-8,900 is still holding and also established a smaller support level at $9,050-9,100, which is where BTC/USD is currently at.Meanwhile, a potential ascending triangle is ready to form if the price of Bitcoin breaks above $9,300 in the short term.BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows a clear breakdown of the $9,150-9,200 level, which is currently being tested for resistance and a confirmation of this support/resistance flip as it’s currently being supported by the $9,000-9,050 level.This is remarkable for Bitcoin’s price action lately, since the levels have become very narrow resulting in very small price moves. Additionally, as the price acts in such a small range, the volume decreases. Volume typically emerges via a breakout of any construction, which most likely is going to occur next week. Total market capitalization cryptocurrency 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe market capitalization shows more strength than the Bitcoin price. The market cap is showing a clear upward trend that flipped each previous resistance level into support, such as $255 billion (upper green box). The next major step for market capitalization to break through is $270 billion. If that level breaks, a move toward $305 billion is likely.Total altcoin market capitalization 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe total market capitalization is showing more strength than Bitcoin because of the recent strength in altcoins as of late. The total altcoin market cap shows a clear breakout and support/resistance flip of $91-92 billion. As long as the green box remains to support and the total altcoin market cap doesn’t drop below, the altcoins will likely continue the rally.The next area of resistance to watch is $113 billion, which is approximately twenty percent from here. The bullish scenario is primarily built around breaking through the $9,200 resistance level, and another test of the support level could impact the bullish scenario.BTC/USD 4-hour bullish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe chart shows many untested levels on the upside, which are likely to get tested if $9,200 gets broken through. The first potential level of resistance after $9,200 is the $9,400 resistance zone. As the chart shows, there’s not been a “test” of this previous level. A test means the price rallies towards this level to confirm a rejection by that level. Such a rejection can be classified as resistance, and then the price reverses.However, the chart shows many untested levels above the current price level. Not only is $9,400 untested, but a similar case can be seen with $9,600 and $9,800, for instance. If the price of Bitcoin breaks through $9,200, a support/resistance flip of that level increases the likelihood of $9,600 shortly.Breaking through $9,200 also forms the ascending triangle structure. Then it becomes massively more likely that the price will be testing and revisiting the $10,000-10,500 region and a possible giant breakout further upward. BTC/USD 6-hour bearish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bearish scenario consists of rejecting the $9,200 level and then losing the $9K support level. Every rejection of the previous support level by the resistance would indicate further downward momentum for BTC the price becoming more likely.These signals are confirmations for traders that the price of Bitcoin is ready for a further fall to occur. However, a breakthrough of $9,200 towards $9,400, after which $9,200 is lost as support would also mean that no buyers are stepping in — another bearish signal. As Bitcoin’s price is most likely going to accelerate once it breaks above the $10,500 barrier, the opposite is true for the bearish case if $8,600 support does not hold.This is likely because there aren’t many support levels beneath $8,600, suggesting that the price can quickly drop $1,000 in a few hours as traders’ stop/losses may also add to downward pressure with the price dropping below a critical two-month-long support level. The next major support level beneath $8,600 is the $7,500 range.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

299,"July 15 will go down as an infamous day for Twitter, as an unknown attacker managed to take control of a number of accounts on the social media platform before duping unwary users into a Bitcoin giveaway hoax.The event grabbed media attention, as some of the world’s most notable companies, politicians and business leaders had their accounts compromised before sharing similar messages touting a Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway that required users to send coins to an address before receiving double that amount back.The likes of Tesla founder Elon Musk, former United States president Barack Obama, 2020 U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden, Amazon owner Jeff Bezos as well as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had their accounts taken over to share similar messages telling users to send $1,000 to an address in order to receive $2,000 in BTC in return.The company Twitter accounts of Apple, Uber and CashApp were also used to share the duplicitous messages. The accounts of Hollywood celebrity couple Kanye West and Kim Kardashian and of rappers Wiz Khalifa and the late XXXTentacion were also victims, among other famous people.Notable cryptocurrency figures Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Justin Sun, Charlie Lee, King Cobie and AngeloBTC also had their accounts hacked. Major cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, Coinbase, Bitfinex and Gemini fell victim to the attack along with the Twitter accounts of Bitcoin and Ripple.Some of these accounts did not directly list the same Bitcoin address as Musk and others but rather prompted users to visit a malicious website in order to be considered for a fake 5,000 BTC giveaway. Users would allegedly receive double the amount of BTC they sent to the given address.The website has since been taken down, and the domain registration information has now been removed from the Whois domain registration database for privacy reasons. Nevertheless, the name of the registered owner and their physical address was widely published.The latest search of the BTC address shared by Musk and other compromised Twitter accounts shows that it has received 12.86584703 BTC since the heist began. The attackers also tried to gain control of Cointelegraph’s Twitter account but were unsuccessful.For some of the unfortunate targets of the hack such as CZ, who is the CEO of Binance, such a large-scale hack of Twitter accounts belonging to high-profile users and the theft of over 12 BTC is “a wake up call for social media platforms.”There’s evidence that the attacker may have been helped by an existing Twitter employee or developer, as they had access to the administrative panels of the various accounts that were compromised. Twitter confirmed that the attackers had accessed internal employee tools that allowed them to take full control of the various accounts. Other users on Twitter speculated that the attackers changed either the phone numbers or email addresses for verification in order to take control of the accounts.Vice’s Motherboard reported that screenshots of a hacker using an internal Twitter user administration tool on a number of the accounts in question were being shared among hacking groups. The publication also claimed that hackers confirmed they paid a Twitter employee in order to gain access to the tools needed to carry out the attack.For example, a screenshot of the admin panel of Binance’s Twitter account was shared and widely published across social media. It’s understood that Twitter then began removing screenshots of user admin panels that were posted by various accounts on the platform — given the sensitive information displayed on these pages.Twitter then took measures to curb any further damage by locking the affected accounts and removing the nefarious tweets. Following that, the social media platform then limited the functionality of a larger group of verified accounts while it investigated the situation. As a result, users began to experience limited functionality. The Whale Alert Twitter account informed its following that the changes meant that its bot could no longer alert users with automated posts on the platform.Adding intrigue to the saga is the discovery by users on Reddit of a not-so-hidden message in one of the transaction outputs. The sender of this particular transaction spent $11 in transaction fees to have the following text included in the tx output:“Just Read All. Transaction Outputs As Text. You Take Risk When Use Bitcoin. For Your Twitter Game. Bitcoin is Traceable. Why Not Monero.”What is not clear is whether the sender of this message was responsible for the Twitter hack or just another user taking the opportunity to tout the privacy-centric cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).A little over 24 hours after the hack, the attackers began to move some funds to an address that had previously sent Bitcoin to wallets on BitPay and Coinbase. The various Twitter accounts that were compromised had prompted users to send their BTC to one address, but the funds have now been moved to another address.Blockchain analytics company Whitestream has identified three different transactions from the address to these mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges. One involved a transfer of 1.2 BTC in May, while the latter two transactions were made two days before this ongoing Twitter debacle.Cointelegraph has also reported that Binance, Coinbase and BitGo may have information that could identify those behind the hacking incident. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance’s CZ to find out if Twitter had divulged any details of how hackers gained control of the company’s account as well as his personal profile. CZ confirmed that there had been no information from Twitter regarding who had been responsible for the attack.Looking at the incident from an ideological perspective, CZ believes that the breach does not necessarily reflect badly on Bitcoin and proves that the cryptocurrency is inherently valuable. On the flip side, CZ says it’s hard to argue against the idea that the hack has reflected poorly on Twitter and its internal security system, which should lead to improvements:“We believe this is a good wake up call for all social media platforms to revamp their security practices given the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. Social media platforms are no longer just a place to share a selfie, it can and will be used for financial transactions and even crime. Stronger security needs to be built into these platforms.”CZ highlighted the reality that many social media platforms don’t even offer two-factor authentication options. This was the case with Twitter until recently, but even the introduction of 2FA was made redundant by other security options that bypass its efficacy:“Twitter added the 2FA feature not long ago, but its implementation is flawed and leaves the ability for an attacker who brute-force attacks your account to lock the original owner out of the account. It even resets 2FA and email address, which defeats the purpose of 2FA. I tweeted about this less than a month and half ago.” If it was a hack on Twitter’s back-end administration system itself, CZ suggested that Twitter and other social media platforms need to “quickly move to a zero-trust security architecture where even internal employees can’t make these types of account take-overs.”CZ believes that this hack shines a spotlight on what he described as an “inherent flaw built into the centralized web,” which has unfortunately involved Bitcoin as the method of stealing funds. However, the Binance CEO believes that there is a positive to come out of the high-profile event, as attention will now be set on fixing the issue: “This is something we, the crypto industry players, have been asking for a long time, and it will finally get real attention.”Cybersecurity company Kaspersky also weighed in on the series of events that have transpired in a correspondence with Cointelegraph. Kaspersky’s threat research and security intelligence communications officer, Blair Dunbar, said that the company was only able to draw conclusions on the facts that have been publicly confirmed:“Twitter wrote that several of its employees were victims of the attack. This suggests that the criminals attempted to gain access to the platform’s infrastructure through their accounts. In addition, the fact that the criminals were able to immediately gain access to such a large number of accounts suggests that something internal in the system was compromised.”According to Dunbar, the motive behind the attack seems to have been financial gain, which points to a criminal group. The company believes that a nation state would have used the access to collect “private information, such as DMs from persons of interest” rather than taking control of high-profile company accounts such as Uber, Apple and the various exchange accounts that were compromised.While the situation was a negative one for both Bitcoin and Twitter in terms of public perception, Dunbar believes that it does not necessarily mean that the cryptocurrency is only used as a vehicle for hackers. “Any criminal can abuse cryptocurrency for their own malicious purposes, but that does not mean that the cryptocurrency itself is to blame.” Furthermore, he thinks that Twitter will bounce back from the incident: “As for Twitter, they will need to work to regain users’ trust. That said, they seem to be taking the breach seriously.”According to Dunbar, the situation is a stark reminder that users of social media platforms and online tools should be aware of the threat of hacks and nefarious organizations, and practice good safety measures. But most importantly, users “should be skeptical even if this information comes from a supposedly trustful source.”Likewise, CZ offered a reminder that the public should do its due diligence when it comes to any online giveaways, donations and projects: “This is also an educational opportunity for the mass population and an important step for people to learn how not to fall for online scams, even if your favorite idol asks you to donate or transfer funds.”"

Source: Elon Musk TwitterResponding to a sarcastic tweet asking Musk for lost Bitcoin, Musk wrote:“Excuse me, I only sell Doge!”The price of DOGE rose by 14% on the day. Source: TradingView.comAfter Musk’s viral tweet, the price of Dogecoin rose from $0.003052 to $0.003433, by around 14%. Whether DOGE rose as a result of Musk’s tweet cannot be certain. Unlike top cryptocurrencies, DOGE has relatively low liquidity, which leaves it vulnerable to short-term pump and dumps.In recent weeks, a viral TikTok sensation sent the price of Dogecoin surging. Data from CoinMarketCap shows Dogecoin rose from $0.0023 to as high as $0.005 within merely three days from July 6 to 9 as a result.Musk’s tweet appears to be in reference to Dogecoin's sudden increase in popularity in the mainstream. The unexpected spark in interest about the cryptocurrency on TikTok garnered significant media coverage.Throughout the past year, ever since Musk declared that his favorite cryptocurrency is Dogecoin, he has continuously tweeted about crypto. Musk said in April 2019:“Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.”In mid-2019, Musk won a poll to become a self-proclaimed CEO of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. That only propelled Musk to write even more sarcastic jokes about cryptocurrencies.In May, in response to J.K. Rowling’s tweet about Bitcoin, Musk wrote: “Pretty much, although massive currency issuance by govt central banks is making Bitcoin Internet money look solid by comparison.”He added:“I still only own 0.25 Bitcoins btw.”Musk seemingly enjoys entertaining the crypto industry with the occasional meme tweets. He quite clearly is not a serious investor in cryptocurrencies, unlike the likes of other popular figures such as Paul Tudor Jones.But, there is a silver lining with having arguably one of the most high-profile and influential CEOs in the U.S. tweet about crypto regularly.Cryptocurrencies, as an asset class, still remain as a niche market for many investors. The market capitalization of Bitcoin, the most dominant cryptocurrency in the global market, is smaller than that of Tesla.Dan Tepiero, the founder of DTAP Capital, wrote:“Not looking like a top in TSLA. In fact, just broke out 7 days ago. At this rate, Elon Musk becomes world's richest person in a few months. The market is always right. What is it telling us about the future? Net worth now equal to 25% of all Bitcoin. Maybe he buys a few?”For an asset class in an early phase of growth, cryptocurrencies could benefit from the publicity Musk brings to the industry."
301,"European Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Northern Data has seen its stock fall 40% in days amid claims that it committed fraud.Data from Bloomberg showed the company’s NB2 stock trading at under €47 ($53.70) at the end of July 17, down from €79 ($90.30) on Monday.Northern Data, the product of a 2019 merger between U.S. company Whinstone and Northern Bitcoin, claimed to offer High Performance Computing/Artificial Intelligence (HPC/AI) solutions.While touting the scale of its computing capacity to investors and analysts, including well-known German bank researchers, one critic in particular argued that in fact, the company was mostly involved in Bitcoin mining hosting.For well-known investigative Twitter user BTCKING555, suspicions arose when Northern Data failed to respond to basic questions about its business.Thereafter, a Medium post delivered a longer exposé, after which Northern Data hit mainstream media and its share price tumbled.“It’s a very unpleasant point in time,” Maximilian Martin, head of finance at Northern Data, commented to the Financial Times. “It gives the anonymous trolls a power of influence. I’m not concerned because I know we’re no criminals — that’s the biggest point of differentiation. We’re as transparent as it gets.”Northern Data share price 1-month chart. Source: BloombergThe Medium post disagrees. Taking issue with everything from revenue to pricing, it also casts doubt on the legitimacy of those who invested in the company itself, among them well-known crypto companies SBI Holdings and The Block.It summarized:“As such we make a conclusion: 1) Northern Data clients are paying lower, industry competitive, rates and the company is cooking the books; or 2) The company has found the dumbest customers in the crypto industry and milking the most it can for its whopping 40% gross margin.”The debacle is grimly pertinent, coming within weeks of another German scandal involving financial firm Wirecard.After $2 billion went unaccounted for, the company folded, with the knock-on effects impacting consumers worldwide. Any funds tied to Wirecard, such as those on prepaid debit cards, were suddenly frozen, leaving users without their money. As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin debit cards were also affected. Before its own difficulties, Northern Data was another example of cryptocurrency business equity vastly outperforming cryptoassets themselves — often thanks to roadmaps that include plans such as conducting an initial public offering, or an IPO.Other firms such as Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN) have not fared as well, however, with its stock price down nearly 70% YTD or from around $6 to $1.92 at press time."
302,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) consistent failure to break the $9,400 level over the past three weeks has led to some analysts becoming skeptical about the chance of a positive breakout. Although the $9,000 support has been holding strong for the past 50 days, any slightly negative indicator tends to get more attention from media and pundits. Recently, crypto media has focused on Bitcoin’s 25 % skew as proof that options traders are turning bearish in the short-term, but in reality there’s more to it than just interpreting signals from one data point. Skew is an options-trading concept that compares the volatility rates between put and call options within the same expiration date. A positive skew means implied volatility for puts is larger than calls, indicating a higher insurance cost for a downside price move.One can usually assume that investors are more bearish, since the protection for downside is more costly than the upside protection but deeper analysis shows this is not the case at this moment. First, the current level is not something unseen in history, in fact, it’s quite the opposite. The most common measure uses 25% delta, which translate to options being priced with 25% probability of happening.Bitcoin options 25% delta skew. Source: SkewAs the chart shows above, the 1-month 25% delta skew peaked at 23% on May 21, compared to the current 12%. Meanwhile, the 3-month options displayed similar movement with previous peaks at 6% compared to the actual 4%. By no means is skew indicating anything unusual or extremely bearish.Regardless of the protection for the downside being more expensive than the upside, one should determine if investors are effectively buying such options. This is done by measuring call options open interest up to 20% from the current $9,150 price and comparing it to the put options down to 20%.Deribit July Bitcoin options open interest. Source: DeribitAt the moment, call options up to $11,000 BTC total 13K, slightly more than the 12K puts open interest down to $7,500 BTC for July expiry. The following month the situation is even more biased with 18K calls open interest versus a mere 3.5K put options.This shows that not much is being traded on the put options side, in comparison to the bullish call options. This ratio somewhat diminishes the importance of the skew curve.Another way to gauge professional investors sentiment is by looking at futures markets premium to perpetual and swaps. Longer-term contracts tend to trade somewhat higher, in a situation known as contango, signaling a healthy market.Bitcoin futures annualized 3-month basis. Source: SkewThe 3-month annualized premium has been at a firm 4% level, its highest in 30 days, therefore, there is no evidence of fear or investors leaning bearish on the futures markets.It's improbable for a single derivatives indicator to provide a clear market picture as the Bitcoin (BTC) options market is still a nascent industry. Furthermore, a single exchange currently encompasses 80% of BTC options open interest. Distortions could also be caused by the current exposure of options market makers who may not be interested in adding risk at the current level of implied volatility.By measuring the put/call open interest for each expiry, one can get a better glimpse of professional investors' bets, and both the July and August expiries are favoring bullish positions. A 25% delta skew by itself should not be interpreted as a bearish indicator, so be wary of those who suggest it is.

303,"Given the rate at which Grayscale usually buys Bitcoin, it seems like the cryptocurrency fund management company was trying to buy every single Bitcoin in existence. But this pattern ground to a halt more than three weeks ago and hasn’t picked up again since.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC) would typically file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on a weekly basis, declaring its latest Bitcoin acquisitions. But the last time such a report was filed was June 25, when the company disclosed the purchase of almost 20,000 BTC. According to its second quarter report, GBTC was raking in an average of $57.8 million a week in investments.A Grayscale spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the halt in BTC purchases is temporary, and is due to an administrative quiet period:“There was an administrative quiet period for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust private placement. The Trust is now open for subscription as of Friday, July 10 at 4:00pm ET.”In any case, Grayscale has not issued any SEC disclosures about new Bitcoin acquisitions since then.It is important to note that GBTC is not a hedge fund that buys assets on the expectation of profiting from them later. Instead, it buys Bitcoin whenever investors buy its shares. Currently, each share corresponds to 0.00095891 BTC. In the second quarter, 84% of the investments into Grayscale came from the institutional investors, mostly hedge funds. Thus, this reversal is indicative of the institutional interest in the asset. The company itself was boasting of its prowess, buying more Bitcoin than was being mined:“After Bitcoin’s halving in May, 2Q20 inflows into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust surpassed the number of newly-mined Bitcoin over the same period. With so much inflow to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust relative to newly-mined Bitcoin, there is a significant reduction in supply-side pressure, which may be a positive sign for Bitcoin price appreciation.”There are at least a couple of possible explanations to this sudden pullback. One is seasonal — July tends to be a slow time for investment activity. Many asset managers travel or take vacation. Another reason could be that Bitcoin hasn’t done much in the last few months. Bitcoin weekly price chart (Coinbase).

304,"Igor Krasnov, Russia’s new Attorney General, says that cybercrime in Russia has surged 25 times over the past five years.

The total number of Russian cases for all of last year was just 294,000, Krasnov said.He cited a number of crimes, like drug trafficking, corruption, and terrorism financing, as often facilited via cryptocurrencies and data encryption tools that maximize anonymity. The conviction rate of such crimes amounts to just 25% to date, Krasnov added.The Attorney General suggested creating an automated system for tracking cybercrime online, as well as “radically change the existing approaches to police operations and preliminary investigations” of such cases.While the Russian Attorney General has voiced the need to develop more tools for fighting crypto-related cybercrime, the status of crypto itself is not yet clear in the country.Despite multiple warnings to ban or criminalize cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the legal status of Russian crypto remains unclear to date. In June 2020, a Russian court denied a motion to provide restitution to a victim, arguing that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have no legal status."
305,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said he considers China ahead of the U.S. as both countries wade the regulatory waters of the burgeoning crypto space.As part of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Parallel Summit on July 17, Garlinghouse expressed admiration for China’s approach to the crypto space. “In some ways I’m in awe of it,” he said.China’s position comes from an appreciation for crypto’s potential, Garlinghouse posited. He explained:“I think they’re realizing that some of these technologies may in fact be very foundational for the future of how financial systems work, and they want to make sure that they have capabilities at the heart of them.”Offering rationale, Garlinghouse mentioned Bitcoin and Ethereum regulatory classification as an example.U.S. regulating bodies came forward in 2018 and 2019, classifying Bitcoin and Ethereum not as securities, but as Commodities. Such rulings now give companies and individuals more confidence in participation around those assets, the Ripple CEO explained.“Today, because of the mining control of Bitcoin and Ether in China, these are technologies controlled by China,” Garlinghouse said. “Twenty-five years ago the U.S. was a leader in making the internet what it is today, but part of that came from regulatory clarity,” he added.The Ripple head said the same possibility for advancement currently exists around blockchain, although the U.S. has not jumped on the opportunity, pointing instead to its focus on other technology like 5g.As the crypto space sits waiting on further regulatory rulings for the thousands of other assets on the market, Ripple’s XRP asset itself sits as a possible security, without firm guidelines on a decision."
306,"Venezuelan Minister of Habitat and Housing Ildemaro Villarroel announced today that crypto mining operations won’t be allowed in any state-owned housing or neighborhoods that are part of the “Gran Misión Vivienda” project (Great Home Mission).During an official speech on July 15, Villaroel stated that any kind of equipment related to crypto mining is banned in public housing due to “high power consumption” and for widely “violating” the government’s electrical supply policy. The minister added:“In this coordinated work, we have detected the harmful effects of these elements of high electrical demand in the public houses of the Gran Misión Vivienda project.”Gran Misión Vivienda is a plan by the Venezuelan government to grant housing to citizens with low income amid a long-lasting economic crisis that the country had already been facing before COVID-19 showed up.Villarroel says that crypto mining activities could harm the distribution of the power supply in every neighborhood. But critics of the measure, primarily through social media, point out that the Venezuela was negligent in improving the local electric supply system. The issue went major after a national electrical shutdown in 2019 as a result of the failure of the “Guri” hydroelectric dam.Recently the Bolivarian National Guard of Puerto Ordaz seized 315 Bitcoin (BTC) mining machines manufactured by Bitmain. The owners of the mining rigs were told that they did not possess the necessary permits to own and operate the machines."

309,"Crypto-focused institutional trading desks are lately springing up. While Wall Street investment banks and hedge funds are still in the early stages of involvement, a class of crypto-native funds founded by institutional pros is by now well established.Cointelegraph interviewed the co-founder of one of these funds, CMS Holdings’ Dan Matuszewski, to learn more about his views on the crypto market.Before involving himself in crypto in 2012, Matuszewski worked for some years at Bay Hill, an institutional hedge fund. Most of his career was nevertheless tied to crypto, with a brief stint at Kraken and a longer tenure as the head of the OTC desk at Circle.In 2019, Matuszewski left Circle to co-found CMS Holdings, a fund that “operates like a hedge fund” despite only working with principal capital — the co-founders’ own money.He shared his views on the growing derivatives market in crypto, highlighting some of the differences with traditional markets.While derivatives have been growing, their volume is still below that of spot, or direct crypto trading. The majority of derivatives volume comes from futures, a derivatives contract that seeks to closely follow the price of the underlying asset. Commenting on this, Matuszewski said:“The derivatives market is always going to dwarf the spot market, just because there’s bigger access to leverage and it's just a lot easier to trade.”But Matuszewski finds it odd that leverage in crypto is so high. “The fact that you can go 100x on Bitcoin, it's kind of wild to me,” he added. In his view, these crypto derivatives are “really treated more like a casino” rather than a hedging tool, as they see much higher retail trader participation who have “much more of a gambling mentality.” Though he disclaimed that traditional derivatives products are also highly speculated upon.The differences in risk approaches are amply shown by CME Bitcoin futures. While the exchange allows double or triple digits of leverage for gold futures, on Bitcoin the maximum leverage is only about 3x, though it varies each day as maintenance margins change.“I hope a lot of people aren't doing that [using 100x leverage]. But Arthur [Hayes, CEO of BitMEX,] put out a post about BitMEX average margin usage [...] and it’s high. People are pretty wound up on that thing.”Matuszewski noted that futures by themselves are not particularly new for crypto, as some platforms offered them even when he first got into crypto in 2012. BitMEX popularized them in 2018, which led to a host of competitors springing up. But Matuszewski believes they do not have much to compete on:“There's only a couple of permutations right now. You give people more things to trade, or you give them more access to trade what they have already. So it’s either leverage or new assets.”On leverage, he noted that “there’s not that much further you can go.” Until volatility falls to consistently low levels, there will be an upper bound on it. “You can't give somebody 500x leverage in Bitcoin because the bid offer [spread] will just liquidate them,” he added.Nevertheless, he believes that the derivatives market will keep growing:“I think that's the trend, I think people will be getting more in the derivatives space than spot going forward. Options markets will grow, Deribit’s had very good growth on that thing, CME just got into it.”"
310,"Cybersecurity experts are warning about a family of banking trojans that target Windows users across Latin America, but this trojan happens to focus on stealing cryptocurrencies.According to a report published by cybersecurity firm ESET, the malware is known as “Mekotio” and has been active since approximately March 2018. Since then, threat actors have been continuously upgrading the capabilities and range of attack, mostly known by targeting over 51 banks.But now the trojan is focusing on Bitcoin (BTC), instead of just stealing banking details. This implies that Mekotio is targeting individual users.The malicious campaigns were delivered through phishing emails by the hackers, and are directed mostly toward Chile and other countries in that region. Still, there have been some cases in Spain reported.The research specifies that a link is included inside the email body, where users click on it and download a .zip file. Once the user unzips the file, a .msi installer appears. If the user installs it, Mekotio’s attack is successful.Daniel Kundro, a cybersecurity expert at ESET, explained that Mekotio replaces the BTC wallet addresses copied in the clipboard. If the victim wants to make a crypto transfer by copying and pasting a wallet address instead of writing it manually, the exploit replaces the victim’s wallet address with the criminal’s.Kundro warns that cybercriminals behind Mekotio don’t use a single wallet address to receive their stolen BTC. They often use several BTC wallets to avoid easy transaction tracing.But the trojan isn’t limited to just stealing crypto and banking details — it also deploys an attack to steal passwords stored in web browsers.According to a recent study by Group-IB, a ransomware known as ProLock relies on the Qakbot banking trojan to launch the attack and asks the targets for six-figure USD ransoms paid out in BTC to decrypt the files.Cryptocurrencies forensics experts from Xrplorer also warned on June 15 of an elaborate phishing scam where hackers try to steal the secret keys of XRP users, under the false premise that Ripple is giving away tokens."
311,"Seven years ago, agents from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation busted into a San Francisco Public Library to arrest Ross Ulbricht, the mastermind behind the Silk Road. Launched in 2011, the Silk Road was the first modern darknet market where anonymous users could purchase illicit drugs, weapons and other illegal goods using Bitcoin (BTC).Although the Silk Road was shut down in 2013 following Ulbricht’s arrest, many individuals still use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to purchase illicit drugs from darknet markets. For example, a recent press release issued by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, or NCIS, states that over the past year, there has been an increase of drug-related investigations involving Navy personnel. Many of these individuals have specifically been caught purchasing LSD using crypto on darknet markets. The release notes:“Recent law enforcement reporting has revealed that an increasing number of people are moving to purchasing illicit substances via the dark web because of the perceived anonymity provided by tools like The Onion Router (TOR). They also use cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to pay for purchases.”Although darknet markets are havens for tools like TOR, which offer anonymity by obscuring IP addresses, law enforcement officials have been using new techniques to identify purchasers and sellers across these marketplaces. Additionally, while some cryptocurrency transactions can be anonymous, many are traceable. Michael Meyer, the chief information officer of automated crypto trading platform ArbiSmart, told Cointelegraph that while using crypto to purchase illicit drugs may appear to be secure, Bitcoin transactions are not that private:“Even with the transparency associated with crypto, Bitcoin is not as private as people tend to think. Companies like Chainanalysis and CipherTrace are able to provide a lot of details about each transaction, which eventually can reveal the identity of those wallet owners and people involved.”The NCIS has issued a warning to navy personnel regarding the risks involved with making illegal purchases on darknet markets. The NCIS has also noted that international, federal, state and local law enforcement agencies have been working together to infiltrate these markets while identifying and prosecuting those involved.John Jefferies, the chief financial analyst at blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace, told Cointelegraph that virtually all darknet market transactions occur using cryptocurrency. While this may be, Jefferies pointed out that law enforcement is upping its game, saying:“Criminals are either under the misconception that crypto is anonymous, or they think they can launder it. However, the very basics of money laundering in the real world now apply to the crypto world.”In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, established a set of traditional banking regulations to be applied within the crypto sector. Also known as the “Travel Rule,” these new guidelines provide Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures regarding cryptocurrencies. These rules are ultimately meant to prevent cryptocurrencies from being used for money laundering. The FAFT noted that the Travel Rule would be a requirement for digital asset service providers to enforce by June 2020. However, it appears that it may take longer than expected for the entire crypto sector to adopt these regulations.Yet according to Jefferies, some progress has already been made. According to CipherTrace’s spring 2020 cryptocurrency crime and AML report, the global average of direct criminal funds received by exchanges decreased by 47% in 2019. This demonstrates a three-year low for crypto exchanges globally, with only 0.17% of funds received by exchanges in 2019 coming from criminal sources. In addition to the travel rule, Jefferies noted that CipherTrace has created a training program called the “Defenders League” where students are trained by professionals to investigate crypto criminal activities:“It took a while to get the program going, but we already have about 30 students in the training program from a university in Monterey, California, that specializes in financial crime management. We also just created an inbound bot to qualify these cases. When law enforcement becomes more in tune to combat these crimes, this program will help.”It’s also notable that the former U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Sigal Mandelker, recently joined a board of advisors at Chainalysis — a crypto forensics firm that provides crypto transaction data to the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service. It is rumored that Mandelker will help provide Chainalysis with insights on how to properly investigate crypto-related crimes, along with creating partnerships with federal officials.While new procedures are being implemented to combat crimes related to crypto, new challenges have started to emerge, many of which stem from the short-lived success of Silk Road. According to Jefferies, there are still many versions of Silk Road today. He noted that drug dealers will often set up on four or five darknet markets while also creating their own websites as an alternative to generate extra revenue:“We’ve seen an uptick in the number of new darknet markets emerging. We are tracking hundreds of vendors that sell drugs online. Our quarter-four report shows that Russia’s largest darknet market, Hydra, claimed to be doing 100,000 transactions a day with three million users.”In addition, Jefferies mentioned that street crime is becoming more involved with crypto as well. “Drug dealers who would often only accept cash are now accepting cryptocurrencies, actually creating some advantages for law enforcement,” he said. Jefferies further pointed out that drug dealers and other criminals may be turning toward crypto due to the increase of crypto ATMs, or BTMs, which have made it more accessible. According to Statista, as of July 8, 2020, there are 6,366 Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S., and they continue to cause laundering concerns.Todd Maher, the president of compliance at advisory firm BitSource AML Solutions, told Cointelegraph that while there has indeed been an increase in BTM usage, it hasn’t been proven that this is driving criminal activity: “Whether these BTMs are being used for the purchase of drugs has been inconclusive, with tools in place to assist in mitigating illicit usage risk,” further adding: “From the audits and clients that I service, the correlation of Bitcoin purchases to darknet markets and criminal addresses have been minimal.”Maher further noted that each BTM operator is required to have an AML program in place to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. As a registered Financial Crimes Enforcement Network money service business, these providers also require a dedicated compliance officer, an annual audit of their AML program and regular training to assure that there is an acceptable culture of compliance within their operation. He elaborated:“A BTM operation with strong internal controls is able to mitigate a great deal of inherent risk, leaving for a low residual risk. A risk assessment being conducted on their operation with an AML policy addressing these risks is the first step to combating financial crimes.”"
312,"There are still 14 victims of the massive Twitter hack that could still get their Bitcoin back.These victims sent some Bitcoin to a hacker address, but their transactions are still unconfirmed on the Bitcoin network. They are currently hanging in limbo, or Bitcoin mempool. These transactions seem to be unconfirmed after many hours because the senders designated a very low transaction fee that’s unattractive to miners.Bitcoin Core developer Wladimir van der Laan confirmed this to Cointelegraph. “Miners pick the highest fee-rate transactions, but also might have some minimum fee below which they won't mine transactions at all,” he said.For instance, one transaction proposed a fee of 2 Satoshis per byte. The expected delay for a transaction with such a low fee is between 35 and 780 minutes. As van der Laan explained, they may never get processed:“It's possible they'll be processed when there is really nothing more attractive in the mempool (e.g. some downtime in the weekend with little new transactions?), but also, it's possible they'll never be processed and just forgotten about.”The victims with their transactions lingering in mempool can send the same Bitcoin (with the same inputs) to another address they control with higher fees. Even if the miners ever get to processing their original transactions, they will not be confirmed because the Bitcoin protocol checks for the validity of the inputs. Since those inputs would have been spent, the original transactions would be rejected.Hopefully, at least some of the victims will learn their lesson without paying the price."
313,"At the same time that volatility and short-term implied volatility have been sucked out of the market, longer dated options (six months or so until expiration) are still pricing closer to their historical average volatility in the 70% range. This steepness in implied volatility term structure suggests one of two things: Investors expect that this period of low volatility will be transitory and that a catalyst in the next couple of months will once again rock markets, or perhaps sellers of options are just not willing to make a longer-term bet, and as such, are not providing any supply in these longer-term options. The result is a steepness in term structure that could present an opportunity for the volatility-savvy trader.Implied volatility is an interesting asset to trade. Most individual investors who use options as part of their investment strategy do so for the purpose of speculation or protection. They might even employ income generation strategies by selling options against their holdings. They tend to be focused on prices: What level do they think this asset can get to before expiration? Where would they be willing to sell it or buy it? While the nuances of volatility and options pricing may not be obvious to everyone, every trade that a trader makes is implicitly taking a stand on implied volatility. On the other side of the individual investors’ trades are option market makers. These players think of almost nothing but implied volatility. The goal of a market maker is to keep their net position as flat as possible while collecting a bid/ask spread on each trade. The likelihood of order flow being balanced on every single option strike and expiry is essentially zero, so they use implied volatility curves and term structure to relate option prices to each other, keeping their risks balanced even if their position becomes a hodgepodge of long and short calls and puts at all different strikes and expirations. Option market-makers prefer to have all their risks balanced out, but when customer order flow is concentrated in one direction, sometimes that is simply not possible.The result of this unbalanced order flow, with investors happily selling short-dated options while being skittish to sell longer dated options, has led to extreme steepness in the implied volatility term structure in Bitcoin (BTC) options. As of this writing, according to data analytics service Skew, the implication in options prices (as illustrated by forward implied volatility, which is the calculated volatility between two specific expiries) shows the expectation that volatility will realize 30% in the next week, the last week of July will see volatility of 50%, the month of August will see 60%, and the month of September will see 70%. Perhaps the market is right and has great insight about when the current low volatility environment will end. But more likely, order flow is at such an imbalance between expiries that market-makers have twisted the term structure to levels that present some positive expectancy opportunities.If traders wanted to express the opinion that the current cycle of low volatility reinforced by continued short-dated option selling will continue, they would do well to sell both calls and puts on various strikes with expiration dates in six to eight weeks, just after the inflection point where implied volatilities really start to drop off. If the current environment continues, they will likely see gains not just from collecting decay on the option premium, but also from implied volatilities “rolling down” the term structure surface. If they wanted to, or needed to, for margin purposes, they could hedge some of the risk of an unexpected event by buying a few options in much longer dated expiries and a few contracts in cheap, short-dated expiries as well.No one can predict exactly when the next high-volatility market event will come, but it’s likely not tomorrow. It is more likely to happen within the next month, and even more likely than that — within the next two months.It is very reasonable for volatility term structure to be upward sloping, but the current steepness in that slope implies a specific time frame for the reemergence of increased volatility coming in early August. It’s entirely likely that this implication is priced into the Bitcoin options market not because it’s the actual forecast, but because there are plenty of investors willing to sell two-week options, while there are few willing to sell one-month and two-month options.If a trader has the appetite for this risk and believes that there is no specific reason that realized volatility should double within the next several weeks, they could theoretically get paid a hefty premium for selling those options.This is part two of a two-part series on Bitcoin volatility — read part one on the rise and fall of BTC volatility here.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

315,"China controls much less Bitcoin (BTC) mining power than people think, according to a new survey.Released on July 16 by asset manager Fidelity and crypto research firm BitOoda, the survey reveals that China is actually responsible for around 50% of Bitcoin mining — not 65%.Analysts used what they describe as various sources, as well as “confidential conversations” with miners, who agreed to divulge information on aspects such as power cost on the condition that they remained anonymous.“We were able to locate ~4.1GW of power across 153 mining sites, including 67 sites or ~3GW power capacity, with power price data provided upon condition of anonymity,” they summarized in an accompanying blog post.BitOoda further found that 14% of mining now comes from the United States. Nonetheless, estimates in China were hard to corroborate, and the 50% figure remains open to interpretation.“Our conversations lead us to believe that we have accounted for the majority of capacity in the US, Canada and Iceland, but only a small fraction in China and the ‘Rest of World’ category,” the blog post continued.As Cointelegraph reported, previous guesses about China’s involvement in Bitcoin put its capacity share at around 65%.Geographic distribution of surveyed mining capacity vs estimated 9.6GW total capacity. Source: BitOodaContinuing, the survey produced more insights, such as the impact of China’s flood, or “hydro” season on miner revenue.For six months of the year, miners located in provinces such as Sichuan sell less Bitcoin to fund expenses for roughly half the year.“We argue against conventional wisdom, which suggests that low power prices drive Hashrate growth during the flood season,” the blog post states. “In our view, the flood or hydro season shifts the cost curve down for 6 months of the year, leading to lower sales of Bitcoin to fund operating expenses as miners accumulate capital to fund capacity growth.”According to an accompanying chart, average price gains fluctuate inside and outside of hydro seasons, while Bitcoin network hash rate growth stays stable.Hash rate vs. BTC price, segregated by flood and dry seasons.

316,"The ""Wolf of All Streets"" Scott Melker has been unable to do anything more on Twitter than read or retweet more than 24 hours after the massive hack on verified accounts.In a livestreamed interview with Cointelegraph on July 15, the crypto trader said in the midst of the attack he had been unable to verify his account using two-factor authentication. Melker then briefly had full access to read, retweet and post for roughly an hour before having his account restricted following the interview.Twitter Support reported that the platform had “locked accounts that were compromised” and would restore access as needed. As of press time, major verified accounts including those of Joe Biden and crypto exchange Binance were back online, but Melker’s and others are still restricted from posting.The recent Twitter hack which resulted in the platform restricting all verified accounts from posting for hours highlights the dangers of becoming dependent on one platform. Melker said anyone who relies on a centralized service is at risk of having it taken away in an instant.“We cannot depend on centralized platforms, no matter how good their intentions are,” Melker said in his newsletter. “These are single points of failure that you do not control.”The crypto trader said the same circumstances apply to “being your own bank,” i.e. storing private keys in a different safe, and not holding all of one's assets on a centralized exchange.As if the universe wanted his point to sink in, YouTube — a centralized platform if ever there was one — pulled the plug on the Cointelegraph livestream shortly after he spoke, saying the content violated its terms of service.The hacked Twitter accounts posted messages attempting to scam millions of followers into sending Bitcoin (BTC) or cash, promising a 2:1 return. Melker said this was a rather weak attempt given the serious nature of the breach. “They could have literally started a world war, and they’re trying an old scam that’s probably failed every time it’s been tried in history,” he said. The crypto trader considers the hack a “Twitter problem” and not a “Bitcoin problem,” saying the market would have already seen a “super knee-jerk reaction” to the BTC price fairly quickly. Bitcoin did drop 1.4% several hours after the initial hack from $9,191 to $9,058, but had no noticeable surge or downturn as the attack was underway. One possible fallout, according to Melker, would be a greater chance of the general public associating Bitcoin with scams. “It’s just another hurdle to overcome when you’re trying to explain to someone why Bitcoin should be taken seriously,” the crypto trader said.Twitter stock fell from $35.60 to $34.70, a decrease of 2.5% in just 15 minutes during after-hours trading. “Imagine having the most powerful people and companies in the world all angry at you at once,” Melker said in one of his last tweets on July 15 before access to his account was restricted. He told Cointelegraph the company would likely be “sued into oblivion” by those affected, but most users would “forget about this in a week.”"
317,"Craig Jones, a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter based in Australia, has revealed he was one of the poor souls who missed out on the Bitcoin all-time high in 2017 after misplacing his coins.According to a July 16 post on the CoinJar blog, the 29-year-old former International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation World No-Gi Champion and two-time Abu Dhabi Combat Club Trials champion purchased Bitcoin (BTC) in 2015 when the price was roughly $200-400. However, he couldn’t cash in when the price topped $20K in December 2017. Jones said:“Me and a couple of mates bought some bitcoin for s----s and giggles and then forgot about it almost immediately. Then when things went crazy a couple of years later we were all frantically trying to work out who had the password but nobody could remember how to get our account back.”Jones, who is known for utilizing leg locks to take down his opponents, has also been paid prize money in crypto assets. The fighter was awarded $1,000 in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as part of a prize for winning a match in the UK. Melbourne-based crypto exchange CoinJar also announced that they would be sponsoring Jones with crypto via his exchange account. Many prominent names in fighting organizations worldwide have been turned onto cryptocurrency and digital payments. Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighter Jon Fitch became one of the first in MMA to be paid in BTC back in 2015. Cointelegraph also reported in April that UFC fighter Ben Askren used his Twitter account to promote the  Bitcoin rewards halving on May 11."
318,"Zap, the Lightning startup behind a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet, has raised $3.5 million in a seed round in April.As reported by Forbes on July 15, previously undiscovered filings by the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission revealed Zap raised $3.5 million in the April seed round with investors including Green Oaks Capital and Morgan Creek Digital, co-founded by Bitcoin bull Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano.A non-custodial wallet, Zap stands out from others by enabling users to instantly purchase Bitcoin (BTC) using a U.S. bank account via the Lightning Network.Zap CEO Jack Mallers is the grandson of Bill Mallers, who helped found the Chicago Board of Exchange and the son of Bill Mallers Jr., who co-founded brokerage firm First American Discount Corporation. Mallers has said Zap’s ultimate goal is make Bitcoin more accessible and “used for all that it has to offer by the masses.”“Our users today don't ever know we're using Bitcoin when they're using dollars. It's just kind of like we've melted it in the background. I think tens of millions of people will be using this stuff in the next few years, and that just takes a little bit of capital.”As Cointelegraph reported in September last year, Mallers explained crypto newbies could “swipe their debit card, get Bitcoin delivered to them directly onto the Lightning Network, and make inexpensive instant micropayments within seconds.” This solution could lower both the settlement time and fees associated with buying BTC.Zap joined Visa’s Fintech Fast Track Program in June, which enables the app to launch a Visa co-branded card. According to Forbes, the company has several projects involving Visa, but only Zap’s credit card has been announced at this time. “We're contractually obligated to launch one in the next 12 months and we plan on launching one in the next few months,” he said. Cointelegraph reported on July 6 that Maller’s app Strike was in public beta. Though both apps are designed for sending and receiving Bitcoin payments directly to a bank account via Lightning, Strike doesn’t require a wallet, seed, channels or liquidity to operate. Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols have also reportedly been kept to a bare minimum. Zap is far from the only company looking to take advantage of untapped potential on the Lightning Network. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s Square announced in January it had started a Lightning Development Kit which could also lead to Bitcoin payments with lower fees."
319,"A recent newsletter to Delphi Digital clients delved into the economic aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and how the current fiscal stimulus package from the U.S. Federal Reserve could be propping up equities markets and the entire economy.  According to the firm, COVID-19-related government spending has breached the $1.1 trillion mark, bringing June’s monthly budget deficit to $864 billion, the worst in U.S. history. This has pushed the country’s deficit to $2.7 trillion for the first half of 2020. As the Federal Reserve continues to print money to bolster the economy, important key programs like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) are struggling to produce the expected results as more than 65,000 businesses in the U.S. shut their doors in the last 5 months. Moreover, Goldman Sachs found that 88% of PPP loan beneficiaries are expected to burn through their loans by the first week of August. The International Monetary Fund has also warned that the number of small and mid-sized business filing for bankruptcy may soon triple.U.S. jobless claims. Source: BloombergAlongside the massive number of small and medium-sized businesses shutting down, revenue is down about 20% for the ones that are still open. This comes as no shock given the alarming number of unemployment claims that have been the result of lengthy government-mandated shutdowns. Furthermore, as shown on the chart above, applications for unemployment have decreased, but the recovery is beginning to stall. With Bitcoin trading sideways for the last month and dwindling volume both on spot and derivative markets, many worry that another crash in the U.S. economy could bring Bitcoin price down like it did on March 12. Analysts are now suggesting that if another government stimulus relief package is not approved, investor sentiment will soon turn bearish. If the stock market falls, Bitcoin is likely to follow due to the rising correlation levels between the two. According to data from Skew, realized volatility between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 continues to reach new highs and currently sits at 38.9%. A crash on the stock market could also result in a shock to Bitcoin price and perhaps trigger a cascade of liquidations similar to those that took place on March 12.Bitcoin - S&P 500 1 Year Realized Correlation. Source: Skew.comCurrently, in the U.S. COVID-19 infection rates are pushing to new all-time highs and this is occurring as PPP loan recipients are expected to exhaust their funds. Even more daunting is the fact that at the end of July, the additional federal unemployment benefits provided by the CARES Act are set to cease. These should be interpreted as bearish signals given the high unemployment rate and sharp reduction in consumer spending but recent reporting from Bloomberg suggests Wall Street remains bullish on stocks. This is primarily because investors expect that the Fed will eventually initiate a new round of stimulus that will prop up the stock and bond markets. Analysts at Delphi Digital also believe that a new relief bill will be approved and in the client newsletter the group explained that:“There’s been much debate in Washington as to the appropriate next steps, but it finally appears lawmakers on both sides of the aisle understand the need to act. With President Trump’s reelection chances slipping through his grasp, Republican leaders would be shooting themselves in the foot if they were to delay or block proposals for additional fiscal support.”"

Since 2017, scammers have been impersonating Morgan in an advertising campaign featuring fake statements about his “latest money making method.”On June 16, the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) launched a new system to detect and remove online fraud ads amid the rise of crypto scam ads."

What appears to be a 10 BTC Coinbase withdrawal occurred in the morning of July 15. A couple of hours later, 0.4 BTC originating from the presumed Coinbase withdrawal ended up in 1Ai52U.

322,"The latest report by Peckshield, a blockchain security company, shows that more than $1.4 billion of laundered money has moved onto crypto exchanges in 2020. Peckshield says it has been collecting data both online and offline for more than one year. After verifying and analyzing the data, they were able to identify over 100 million transaction addresses. They could also label more than 50 million mainstream crypto wallet addresses at crypto exchanges.  By leveraging a digital asset tracking platform called CoinHolmes, Peckshield found that some 147,000 Bitcoin (worth more than $1.4 billion US dollars) has moved onto exchanges this year.According to the report, these assets were associated with hacker attacks, the dark web economy, gambling, and so on. Most of the stolen funds landed in major crypto exchanges. According to Peckshield’s report:“We ranked the exchanges with the largest amount of stolen money, and found that the top ten exchanges were: Huobi, Binance, Okex, ZB Gate.io , Bitmex, Luno, HaoBTC, Bithum, and Coinbase.”Source: Peckshield Report Peckshield emphasized that some of the monitored addresses have also moved their funds to crypto mixers, which make it difficult to continue tracing them.“As of June 30, 2020, we have monitored the high-risk address, of which $1.62 billion flowed into the blacklist address and $15.9 billion into the mixed currency service provider In particular, it should be emphasized that most of the funds through the mixed currency service have been successfully laundered.”As Cointelegraph reported previously, wallets associated with PlusToken have been followed by suspected massive open market sales on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Zhou told Cointelegraph:“When there is market volatility, volume spikes. However, when more users enter the market, open interest would naturally increase.

324,"After changing roles several times since its 2009 launch, the current line on Bitcoin (BTC) calls it a store of value comparable to gold — a status with which Abra CEO Bill Barhydt agrees. ""Today Bitcoin is best used as a store of value that will become more and more uncorrelated to traditional investing markets over time,"" Barhydt told Cointelegraph. Following Bitcoin's on-chain beginnings in 2009, the asset traversed a staggering price growth journey, going from less than $1 all the way up to nearly $20,000 at its 2017 peak. Along with this price journey has come various views and use cases for the asset, according to Bitcoin stock-to-flow model creator PlanB during an interview with podcaster Peter McCormack. When Bitcoin reached $1, the narrative focused on the coin's use as a transactionary currency. As its price continued to see tremendous growth over the last decade, the asset found its way into the spotlight as a possible option for wealth storage. The asset has also seen its fair share of comparison to gold, often labeled as ""digital gold.""""The moniker of Bitcoin as 'digital gold' is the best analogy for this that I’ve seen so far,"" Barhydt said following up on his Bitcoin store of value comment. Bitcoin, in theory, does not hold any direct ties to mainstream financial markets as it lies away from governmental control in a borderless fashion. The asset, however, has shown seemingly correlated action with traditional markets at points, while traveling its own price path at other times. ""Bitcoin represents a fantastic insurance policy against traditional markets while governments run amok irresponsibly running their economies into the ground,"" Barhydt said.

326,"Real innovations and breakthroughs don’t happen in the blink of an eye. Bitcoin (BTC) took many years to get to mainstream users since its inception in 2009. The bull market run in 2017 drastically improved crypto market volumes, but institutions still regarded it as another “dot com” bubble.Later, when distributed ledger technology, or DLT, was more widely accepted, a new type of digital asset aimed at bringing stability to the crypto market gained full recognition. Stablecoins had been (and still are) issued by private firms, but many failed to operate successfully for various reasons in 2020.Now, governments are exploring ways to not lose their grip on global finance via technology, developing stablecoins and central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. What will prevail over time, private initiatives or state?The latest research from Big Four audit firm Deloitte indicates that nearly 40% of the firms surveyed have already implemented blockchain in their business ventures. However, the commercially viable immutability of DLT has both pros and cons. An evident benefit with this technology is that no one can retroactively forge crucial data or alter vital information. Blockchain is a perfect demonstration of the trust quantification model gone live.As to the tech’s downsides, even parties who can’t afford any chance of error still make mistakes from time to time: judges, prosecutors as well as various governmental bodies at large. Moreover, all the official services or banking structures experience certain issues and database errors, which they often try to cover up. The blockchain has no preferences, as no user is able to change data or record there, and making a mistake would bring more negative consequences than ever before. Stablecoins’ benefits create significant room for these assets in financial systems. Clients would get faster transactions with lower costs and improved security of their payment systems. Credit risk would also be stabilized. Moreover, simplified cross-border transfers would further drive global financial market development, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of shadow operations. Cash will become obsolete as soon as digital assets are transformed into mainstream and primary methods of payments. The COVID-19 pandemic only incentivized the transition to a cashless society and further discussions about stablecoins and CBDC models, but people’s trust for the technology can’t be built in a day.At the same time, a disruption of traditional banking may result in the loss of competitiveness among digital payment systems, with increased Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures implemented into financial activities likely hampering the way companies do business. Finally, the involvement of the state in technological implementation disrupts the initial vital aspect of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies — decentralization.A stablecoin on a public blockchain frees the system from mandatory AML checks for each transaction. Excessive regulation and globalization have made the supervision function of the payment intermediary totally commercially unprofitable. The risks and potential fines that banks must pay in the event of a money-laundering scandal strongly outweigh the benefits of processing some payments. Since the regulation field has become much more complicated over the past 20 years, banks’ response to this trend is simply denying economic agents the constitutional right to move their honestly earned money and acquire goods or services globally. It is cheaper for a bank to refuse a transaction than to spend resources understanding the details. Therefore, one of the functionalities of stablecoins is their AML-free layer.Since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, among other watchdogs, went on high alert lately, things promise to get hot in the legal field. After the decay of Telegram’s TON and many ongoing problems for Facebook’s Libra ecosystem, it became evident that private companies will face countless challenges in the future. Is there a way for Libra and global stablecoins to survive in 2020 and beyond?The chances are high, but only if they won’t mix different monetary policies of the U.S. dollar and euro zones. Why? The primary target for the Federal Reserve is unemployment, while for the European Central Bank, it is price stability. Going back in history to 2008, the Fed lowered interest rates, while the ECB, in turn, raised them.Meanwhile, the topic of central bank digital currencies has been of major interest as stablecoins gained more popularity in the crypto world. Even before the notorious winter of 2019 occurred, more and more market participants and institutional clients became excited about the stablecoin’s model benefits. World governments and large companies surely noticed the trend and started to experiment in this area, but there had never been any common direction to follow.What is the main challenge of creating a CBDC? Misconceptions about it have only increased, despite numerous discussions, conferences and articles written on the topic.Nothing is arcane about the idea, but the global perception is a bit misguided, since a clear point of view must be taken to understand the CBDC model differences. From a technical, architectural point of view, there are two models: a wholesale CBDC in which central bank reserves can only be accessed and used by a small number of certain financial institutions, or a retail CBDC model in which non-banking institutions can get direct access to digital central bank funds. Many economists and central banks do not support any idea of a universally accessible digital central bank currency. The critical stumbling stone here is that CBDC implementation will result in financial instability and even worse consequences for commercial banks.There are numerous reasons behind the slow pace of crypto acceptance in the world. The whole story is quite the same as with video streaming back in the 90s: Emerging technologies are developing faster than the actual market or the target audience is ready. Infrastructure is of critical importance. In Europe, for example, countries such as Greece and Italy need to install the needed tech infrastructure fast so that users can pay for goods or services if crypto goes mainstream.To gain needed access to the markets and financial services of the crypto industry, the problem of institutional and technological capacity first needs to be solved, but this is unlikely to happen in the near future due to a lack of required infrastructure. It is still unclear when blockchain will scale adequately and whether CBDCs should run on a permissionless one.What is the leading digital currency of the future? Is it digital dollar or digital euro? Or digital yuan, perhaps, as China is currently spearheading this direction. Moreover, the latest news suggests that the Italian Banking Association is also willing to pilot a digital euro. Japan has also joined the club of countries willing to research and experiment with a CBDC.Why are we seeing so much talk and no walk so far? Apart from China, where the digital yuan has made its way from concept to development quite fast, many other government initiatives are often discussed, but no real project by central banks has made its way towards launch. Stablecoins are true die-hard assets of crypto, as out of hundreds of privately run projects, only a few have survived and continued operations in 2020 — Tether (USDT), TrueUSD (TUSD), Paxos (PAX) and EURS.After all, all bets are on for the euro, ultimately. Macro-wise, it’s the only freely convertible currency with almost 500 million of natural populations and a positive current account.Judging by today’s perspective, CBDCs will likely follow a wholesale variant route, which will cut off its accessibility for the retail segment. But there is still a piece of pie for private companies: The imminent launch of wholesale CBDCs and their further existence will not likely hamper the popularity of leading stablecoins.However, a survey made by the Bank for International Settlements clearly indicates that we can expect central banks to issue a retail CBDC within the next few years. Introducing such a retail CBDC poses risks for the data privacy of clients and for financial stability. If retail CBDCs ever become a reality, the commercial banks will suffer heavy losses, since people will run to withdraw their deposits and move it to the central bank accounts. What’s the point of holding savings with commercial institutions that have their own credit risk and are fractionally reserved?Will such a solution prevail over private projects like Tether at some point? If implemented successfully, it will be inaccessible to the general public, but rather become a wholesale asset invisible to John Citizen. Can CBDCs kill Bitcoin and other cryptos if launched successfully? Of course not, since the money supply policy will be completely different. Bitcoin supply is like digital gold, capped at 21 million, while CBDCs or stablecoins will closely correlate to the M2 money supply.The competition between various models will ultimately determine the winner. But the legalization of stablecoins for private companies is crucial now, as allowing them to have a legal account in a state bank or government bonds will widen the market and ultimately benefit the development of the next stage of the digital economy.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Gregory Klumov is a stablecoin expert whose insights and opinions appear regularly in numerous international publications.

327,"Compound, the Decentralized Finance protocol, reached the $1 billion dollar mark in funds borrowed from its protocol on June 13, with its top three markets being the DAI and USDC stablecoins followed by Ether (ETH).Currently, MakerDAO’s DAI takes the lead with 79.88% of value borrowed from its protocol. Stablecoins seem to be popular in Compound due to its COMP reward mechanism which gives users COMP tokens according to the dollar value borrowed.Compound allows users to deposit certain cryptocurrencies to earn interest and to borrow different tokens or stablecoins (useful for short-selling for example), while providing users with COMP token rewards for engaging in both activities.Over the past few weeks this system has made Compound protocol extremely popular and it currently has $1.6 billion in assets locked to their liquidity pools. At the moment, a number of DeFi protocols are also showing considerable increases in the amount of borrowed and locked funds. For example, Aave currently holds over $250 million in its liquidity pools, according to data from Aavewatch.DeFi has been making huge progress in terms of visibility, especially following the disproportional buzz created by the Coinbase-backed Compound project. At least 10 DeFi-related tokens have seen more than 100% gains and this in part due to the COMP reward mechanism and yield farming which allows users to act both as lenders and borrowers in order to earn COMP tokens for this dual role.In its first week of trading, COMP rose by 233% and has since been listed on Coinbase and Kraken. Aave’s LEND token has rallied more than 1000% in the last 3 months, from around $0.02 to $0.24.Not only are the price of DeFi-related tokens rising along with the value locked and borrowed from these protocols, the tokens that are available in these protocols have also been generally performing well.Coupled with the high interest rates and yield farming possibilities, it’s safe to say that DeFi has been a gift that keeps on giving for early adopters of the platforms and of their respective tokens.Examples of this include Chainlink (LINK) which is the biggest cryptocurrency on the Aave protocol following the LEND token itself.The impact of the defi protocols on other tokens was most visible through Basic Attention Token (BAT) which became the most used ERC-20 token in all of DeFi, surpassing even ETH and DAI, for two weeks, before the COMP reward mechanism was updated.While it is easy to understand that DeFi is growing, the price surge in the associated tokens like LEND and COMP is somewhat unrelated. Although tokens like NEXO give users a share in the revenue, LEND and COMP do not.These tokens, however, give their holders voting rights over the protocol. In other words, they are governance tokens and do not pay any dividends.While there is no immediate monetary benefit, having a stake in the future of these platforms may hold some unmeasurable value depending on how they scale over time. Moreover, hype and right-out speculation around the DeFi space has surely helped some of these governance-associated tokens.As the DeFi sector continues to break record numbers in activity and the amount of funds locked and lent increases, it seems possible that DeF tokens will continue to outperform Bitcoin, especially as the digital asset’s volume and volatility continues to dwindle."
328,"Two Italian 17-year-olds were arrested for paying Bitcoin (BTC) to see children being sexually abused, tortured and murdered in live streaming.Local media Il Messaggero reported on July 15 that the deep web website viewed by the two also allowed users to pay extra to decide what torture the children would be subjected to next. Italian law enforcement explained:“Users that were able to reach those kinds of obscure environments are allowed to take part in acts of sexual violence and torture on minors, performed live by adults.”The services offered by the website have different costs. Viewing a pre-recorded video costs much less than watching live, but in both cases the viewing concludes with the death of the child. The article also provides another example, according to which “viewers can for instance request them to amputate a children’s arm or to pour hot oil over the victim.” Law enforcement said:“The live requests really cost a lot of money and ensure particularly high profits to the foreign organizations that carry out those inhuman acts.”The two were searched as part of an ongoing investigation that has so far involved 25 people — 19 minors and six over 18 — residing in 13 Italian provinces. The operation is nicknamed “Delirio” — delirium in Italian — by local law enforcement. It started in October and resulted in tens of searches.The two arrested are a man and a woman who exchanged details pertaining to what they referred to as a “red room.” The man often shared with the women grim details of the livestreams.Media found include pedopornographic videos self-made by minors, videos of children as young as three-year-olds being molested by adults, and videos depicting violence often accompanied by Nazi symbology.It is unclear whether the website offering the services was shut down, but presumably only some of its viewers were caught. Local law enforcement has not answered Cointelegraph’s inquiry.Cryptocurrencies’ pseudonymity and the lack of governmental control over them make them suitable for criminals. Among such criminals, we can find political dissidents, whistleblowers and journalists, but also pedophiles, drug dealers and black-hat hackers.There have been many worldwide reports on the use of Bitcoin and other crypto assets specifically in child porn dealings. For instance, at the end of June Spanish law enforcement took down a dark-web child porn ring that used cryptocurrency transactions to pay for content."
329,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility hitting its lowest since late 2018 has forced investors to turn to altcoins that could act as more lucrative investments in their portfolios. Cardano (ADA) has been one of the largest benefactors of this move. Its price has rallied around 400% in 2020; its market capitalization has almost quadrupled to surpass Bitcoin SV (BSV); and it has become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in circulation by market capitalization.The recent price rally has demonstrated the faith the community and industry have in Cardano’s roadmap, its vision and its founder, Charles Hoskinson. The project, however, is still in its nascent stages. There is still a lot for Cardano to prove in terms of executing its plans and gaining recognition among prominent entities like Ethereum.However, Ryan Fang, the co-founder and chief operations officer of Ankr — a firm that provides cloud solutions for blockchain applications — feels more confident in Cardano’s proven abilities, the community and its network. Talking also of his holdings in Cardano, he stated:“The price rally has been tremendous, as it broke two resistance levels. We have been watching Cardano from more than a year with their development since the testnet till the mainnet. The network has emerged a lot, and the price rally has proved the strong market sentiment of the project and the trust community has got on the project.”The price rally in 2020 went rampant after the announcement of the Shelley upgrade on May 25 and even further when Cardano began releasing the code for Shelley on July 7. This upgrade is said to be unique because Cardano claims it will make the network from 50 to 100 times more decentralized than other prominent blockchains. It has also enabled staking to reach 1,000 stake pools.In contrast with Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm, Cardano runs on a proof-of-stake algorithm called Ouroboros. PoS is a method that secures a decentralized blockchain network by allowing people who hold that blockchain’s tokens to validate transactions and blocks. This process allows stakers to earn tokens, also known as block rewards, proportional to the amount staked. Fang further commented that the implementation will open up competition for consumer adoption, adding: “It’s a very bold and challenging move to implement. ETH has been trying to do this since more than 2-3 years now. But Cardano being able to achieve the consensus protocol on Proof of Stake algorithm is commendable.”Cardano’s incentivized testnet was first launched back in December 2019 to enable staking rewards for engagement during the testing period of the Shelley upgrade. Currently, there are more than $13 billion ADA staked on ITN.The term “smart contracts” was introduced about 26 years ago by cryptography expert Nick Szabo and has been one of the most integral developments in the crypto industry. Smart contracts are transaction protocols maintained by computers that are intended to automatically execute, control or document transactions according to the terms of the contract.For Cardano, the implementation of the Goguen era will take smart contracts a step further to “smarter contracts.” While smart contracts eliminate the need for manual intervention for interactions on a particular blockchain, the Goguen mechanism will not prioritize ADA transactions and contracts over other tokens issued on Cardano, like Ethereum does for Ether (ETH) over ERC-20 tokens.Related: Here Comes ‘Shelley’: ADA Price Excels With Cardano Upgrade InboundBakyt Azimkanov, the communications and marketing director at Cardano, told Cointelegraph how the Goguen era will create use cases through decentralized application: “The Goguen era will open the way for the development of enterprise-level and mission-critical decentralized smart contract applications, which is the first crucial step to building and deploying real-world solutions on Cardano.” Sumit Gupta, a co-founder and the CEO of CoinDCX, shared his opinion with Cointelegraph:“Rather than being a single-asset ledger, Cardano will become a multi-asset ledger that allows users to define, forge and transfer their custom tokens on the network. The Goguen update will help developers build decentralized apps on Cardano’s blockchain network with greater flexibility.”This mechanism intends to provide developers with more security on the network, as all the tokens will inherit all the security and smart contract behaviors that Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, would have. Azimkanov stated on the matter:“In the deployment of decentralized applications built on top of blockchain protocols, smart contracts become particularly useful. By virtue of their trustless nature, users can interface with Web 3.0 applications without entrusting their sensitive information to the app developer, and the developer or smart contract creator receives guaranteed and automatic settlement at the point of contract maturity.”Cardano has been looking to solve issues previously encountered on other platforms like Ethereum and Ripple. This aspect enables the platform to bring more investors without diluting its base of believers who don’t hold the coin to speculate or hedge against another bet in their portfolio.Looking at the one-year ownership structure composition, it’s clear that Cardano has seen continued support, with the proportion of hodlers consistently being over 50%. However, the proportion of traders has also been significantly rising in 2020, proving that ADA has started to see more volatility in anticipation of the official launch of Shelley.Even Ryan Selkis, the founder and CEO of Messari, has recently stated that Cardano has “plenty of room for growth” and that the recent price surge highlights the excitement around staking ahead of the Shelley upgrade. An announcement that ADA holders would be able to stake their assets in Coinbase custody by Q4 2020 has fueled speculation even further that ADA may be listed on Coinbase by the end of this year.Related: Overview of Crypto Staking Networks"
330,"Bitcoin (BTC) must reclaim $9,400 as soon as possible in order to change its bearish course, says Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb.In an update on social media on July 16, the popular trader warned that the situation facing Bitcoin was fast becoming make or break.“BTC Bulls need to reclaim $9400 quick sharp,” he wrote in comments on a long-term price chart. Attention focused on BTC/USD being stuck in a compression cycle which has lasted for multiple weeks. Compression refers to a pattern of higher lows and lower highs, with a trading corridor narrowing before a breakout.For Bitcoin, the danger lies in a potential climax occurring in bearish territory as denoted by the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator.Bollinger Bands consist of an upper and lower band surrounding a middle band and have historically captured both bullish and bearish moves by Bitcoin.BTC/USD chart showing compression cycles. Source: filbfilb/ Twitter“Coming to the end of consolidation/compression now.. doing so below the middle of the bbands is not typically a good sign,” filbfilb continued.Should $9,400 reappear, he added, the outlook would be open to reinterpretation:“Reclaim that level and happy to reconsider bearish bias.”As Cointelegraph reported, looking ahead, bearish scenarios now focus on levels below $9,000 — $8,700 and $8,200, the latter representing Bitcoin’s 20-week moving average.“Bitcoin continues the slow bleed down towards 9k,” filbfilb told Telegram trading channel members earlier Thursday.“Was pretty bad losing the $9,250 level; the weekly support and bottom of the range at $8,700 is looking increasingly likely to be tested.”$9,000 support held up in early trading, with press time levels at around $9,080. BTC/USD remains vulnerable to stock market moves, with a fresh rout more than capable of sending the pair towards bearish targets."
331,"The Twitter hackers who compromised more than a dozen celebrity accounts on Wednesday appear to be consolidating their funds to an address that had earlier sent money to BitPay and Coinbase.According to research from Whitestream, a blockchain analytics company, three transactions originating from the “1Ai5” address lead to wallets associated with Coinbase and BitPay, both of which provide merchant solutions. The legacy address was the first to be offered by the hackers, who later switched to a Bech32 address when targeting non-crypto accounts.However, the original address is now the consolidation point of all the proceeds gotten through the attack. It received 14.75 Bitcoin (BTC), worth about $135,000.Three transactions are believed to be leading to Coinbase and Bitpay. The first involves a transfer of about 1.2 BTC in May 2020, worth about $11,000 at the time. The latter two were sent two days before the hack and are for much smaller amounts.Notably, the latter transactions are much more sophisticated as the change address is always of a different type than any of the other inputs. This makes it more difficult to trace, though it is possible that the hacker was simply in the process of switching to a Bech32 address.According to Whitestream, the first transaction sent a small amount of funds to a BitPay-associated address, while the other two were sent to Coinbase. The hackers’ address appears to be clearly traceable for those companies, possibly exposing their identity. It is however likely that these transactions are related to merchant usage, which could make investigations more difficult.It is also unclear why the hackers used an old address to perform the attack, as it appears to be giving unnecessary clues for the future investigation. Furthermore, given that the hackers owned at least $11,000 before the attack, such a massive account compromise could have been used to publish market-moving announcements. By entering heavily leveraged positions before the tweets, the hackers likely would have made much more money.As Cointelegraph reported extensively on Wednesday, dozens of Twitter accounts from crypto exchanges and influencers, tech companies, politicians and celebrities progressively fell to the hackers. The accounts published a well-known crypto scam that promised to double the money of anyone who sent Bitcoin to a certain address.Twitter said that the issue was due to a social engineering attack performed on high-rank employees with admin access. Through the admin panel, hackers took control of the accounts by changing their passwords and recovery emails.This is similar to a BlockFi data breach in May, where criminals used a SIM swap attack to gain access to internal customer records."
332,"Gold bug and notorious cryptocurrency critic Peter Schiff wonders whether the recent hack of verified profiles on Twitter is “a harbinger of Bitcoin itself being hacked.”In a July 16 tweet, Schiff mentioned yesterday’s mass hack of verified Twitter profiles which were used to promote a Bitcoin scam, further suggesting that it could be a prelude to a hack of the cryptocurrency itself. It looks like all verified Twitter accounts have been hacked by someone running a #Bitcoin scam. For once not being verified has its advantageous. I wonder if this is a harbinger of Bitcoin itself being hacked? Better to play it safe and just buy #gold.Pavel Luptak — co-founder of Czech cryptocurrency community hub Parallel Polis and Hackers Congress Prague — told Cointelegraph that the Twitter hack and the possibility of Bitcoin’s network being compromised have no connection whatsoever:“It's a hack of Twitter, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin was just a scammer's way to ask people for money. Of course, it may be a reputation issue for Bitcoin (I expect some crypto exchanges start to blacklist these stolen Bitcoins). But it is primarily a big reputation issue for Twitter that is not able to protect their user accounts.”As Luptak pointed out, Bitcoin was just a medium of value transfer that the hackers duped their victims into using. In fact — as some community members pointed out in the Twitter thread — the scammer’s decision to use Bitcoin was probably motivated by authorities' inability to censor and reverse Bitcoin transactions.Transaction irreversibility is a highly appreciated feature of Bitcoin that many believe to be the foundation of its value. It is also worth noting that while this Bitcoin characteristic is appreciated by scammers, they also used other systems in the past. Luptak said, “It is necessary to know that most scammers in history used fiat money. [...] This is not a problem of Bitcoin; any currency can be used for scams.”Furthermore, Luptak explained that “Bitcoin has a decentralized protocol, thousands of nodes, everything is transparent and auditable.” All of those features make the network much harder to hack than Twitter.While attacks on Bitcoin’s network — such as a 51% attack — are theoretically possible, it is widely believed that they would be incredibly difficult, so much so as to preclude any potential hacker from even trying. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and so far no coin was stolen on the network through a hack. Luptak recommends:“Be aware of social engineering scams, and of course, [keep in mind that] nobody gives you anything for free.”"
333,"Bitcoin edging ever closer to a $9,000 support level may lead to a major sell-off by exchange users, one analyst warns.According to data from on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, inflows of Bitcoin (BTC) to exchanges spiked on July 15.When traders return Bitcoin to exchanges from a private BTC wallet, it suggests they have a desire to trade or sell at short notice.The opposite is also true. As Cointelegraph reported, exchange balances witnessed a long-term downtrend, which in May, hit its lowest since late 2018, when BTC/USD crashed to $3,100.Now, says CryptoQuant, nervousness over weak price performance appears to be sending a signal to prepare for downward volatility.Eyeing major trading platform Kraken, data shows that on Wednesday, 4,229 BTC ($38.5 million) entered — far more than the average of 500 BTC ($4.55 million) over the past few weeks.While order book data is still forthcoming — Kraken may be presenting an anomaly that does not reflect broad trader sentiment — overall conditions are decidedly bearish.“I expect a small pullback,” CEO Ki Young Ju told Cointelegraph in private comments.Ki added that should a sell-off begin, he did not foresee it matching that from March, when a cascading short event halved BTC/USD within hours.“In my opinion, it’ll be around $8,800,” he said.Bitcoin exchange inflows 3-week chart.

Earlier this week, Cointelegraph analyst Filbfilb highlighted Bitcoin’s 20-week moving average at $8,200 as a realistic buy support zone.For all exchanges, meanwhile, inflows remain far below their March-crash levels, indicating a tendency to hold — not sell — is still in place.Bitcoin exchange inflows 1-year chart.

334,"The Bitcoin (BTC) market has been quiet lately. A little too quiet.  As of Tuesday Bitcoin’s volatility levels had dropped to levels unseen since 2017. In recent weeks, Bitcoin has fallen behind as investors piled into altcoins such as Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) . One possible explanation for Bitcoin’s consolidation may be an increased presence of high-frequency trading (HFT) firms in crypto in recent months. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex explained that he believes HFT is a major reason behind Bitcoin’s low volatility. “In crypto, we are back to the old days of HFT before it became the zero-sum game that it has become today. In crypto HFT firms can make a lot of money deploying relatively straightforward plays, such as cross-exchange arbitrage and exploiting the spread between one exchange and another.” HFT is a trading method that uses algorithms to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second. It has existed in the cryptocurrency space for a long time. But just as billionaire Paul Tudor Jones revealed his Bitcoin holdings recently, other institutional investors are increasingly joining the market. This may explain the greater use of HFT. Bitfinex, which claims to be “huge for HFT in crypto”, recently revealed that between 80 percent and 90 percent of volume on Bitfinex was now generated by HFT firms. Bitfinex partnered with Market Synergy and has been offering “institutional standard cryptocurrency connectivity.” Bitfinex concludes the growing use of HFT represents increasing “maturity in the digital asset space”. But why would Bitcoin volatility go down with increased use of HFT? Ardoino explains the increased liquidity due to the surge of HFT tradings leads to low volatility:  “As Bitcoin becomes an established asset class, we anticipate the high levels of volatility associated with cryptocurrency to recede,” he explained. “There is generally an inverse correlation between liquidity and volatility; i.e., higher liquidity tends to lead to lower price volatility.”“The increasing presence of HFT firms in crypto seems to have added more liquidity to crypto exchanges. This provides sufficient orders for both sides of the order book and increases market efficiency, contributing to prolonged low volatility price consolidation in Bitcoin” Bitcoin is famous for moving aggressively for a short period of time. Last year, Tom Lee of Fundstrat reminded investors that the majority of Bitcoin (BTC) gains come in the ten best trading days of the year. However, the growing presence of HFT may be changing the “rule of 10 best days” as well."
335,"Crypto scammers responsible for what could be the largest ever hack on Twitter were able to succeed because individual employees have high levels of access to information and control on the platform.In a series of tweets from Twitter Support on July 15, the help center of the social media platform confirmed that hackers responsible for the massive breach of high-profile figures’ accounts had conducted a “coordinated social engineering attack” to gain “access to internal systems and tools.”“We know they used this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts and Tweet on their behalf,” Twitter Support said. “We’re looking into what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed and will share more here as we have it.”The account reported the platform had taken “significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools” as the breach is investigated.The hackers were able to post tweets using the accounts of major figures including Barack Obama and Joe Biden to promote a fake Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway which has so far swindled over 300 users out of $118,000. The individual employee admin panels targeted in the hack have significant access to a variety of tools to control the affected accounts, including posting messages on their behalf and changing the verification phone number and email address.Twitter user sniko_ posted screenshots which indicate the fraudsters may have changed the email address for verification for the Coinbase and Gemini accounts, as they were the same following the attack.Coinbase and Gemini password reset screenshotsVice’s Motherboard reported that Twitter was taking down screenshots of user posted shots of admin panels on the grounds that they violated the rules. Images showing access to several Twitter accounts revealed internal admin details including the number of strikes logged against each account, when the account was last accessed, which phone numbers were tied to it, and which email addresses were used for verification.

Source: Motherboard“Sounds bad that a Twitter developer can just login to my account and tweet anything, read my private stuff and all,” said Twitter user 1uc45MH. “If one of them freaks out they can tweet anything on anyone’s account.”The stock market reacted similarly, despite it being after-hours trading shortly after the hack was discovered. Twitter’s stock TWTR fell from $35.60 to $34.70, a drop of 2.5% in just 15 minutes. At the time of writing, the platform’s stock is priced at $34.52."
336,"Earlier this morning, a large-scale Twitter attack took over some of the most powerful verified Twitter accounts including Joe Biden, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Wiz Khalifa, Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Barack Obama, and Jeff Bezos.The attacker has posted about fake giveaways from the compromised accounts, asking for Bitcoin (BTC) payments and promising to send back double the amount received.Many of the accounts were quick to respond to the hack with the Tweets being deleted and Twitter temporarily locking down all verified accounts until the situation has been resolved.Twitter Support said: “We are aware of a security incident impacting accounts on Twitter. We are investigating and taking steps to fix it. [...] We’re continuing to limit the ability to Tweet, reset your password, and some other account functionalities while we look into this.”Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey posted that the team is continuing to investigate what happened and he said: “We all feel terrible this happened.”Multiple companies with compromised accounts have responded. Binance announced that they are taking action to protect their assets by blacklisting the scammer’s addresses and have retaken control of their Twitter account. The exchange also stated that no Binance users has sent Bitcoin to the address.One mystery behind the hack is how the attackers obtained access to so many high profile accounts. One theory suggests the work of an ex/current Twitter employee:“Prob inside job... knew inter workings of Twitter... too obvious... disgruntled employee maybe?”A post by Vice supports this theory with screenshots of Twitter’s internal admin panel uncovered by the underground hacking community. Some users have even named a particular ex-Twitter developer as the man behind the attack —  although this is totally unverified and zero proof was provided.BadCrypto podcast host Travis Wright shared a screenshot that a group called BoboChan was claiming responsibility:Twitter got rekt by this group today. pic.twitter.com/DRlz2nBsNhAndreas Antonopoulos suggested an alternative theory, saying Twitter might not be where the attacker got in, “It seems like some Twitter API posting service has been compromised and being used to send out fake ‘giveaway’ tweets. [...] I don’t think this is a compromise of Twitter.” He went on to say that these services often have weaker security and limited 2FA options.Many of the tweets also refer to ‘CryptoForHealth’ with a link to the site which has since been taken offline.Hacken Group CEO Dyma Budorin warned users this site might also involve malware.“If you have clicked [on] that link then most probably you already have malware [on] your device. Immediately terminate active sessions from twitter and all exchanges accounts. And don’t use this device before the world understands what happened #cryptoforhealth”The attackers appear to have missed a trick as anyone with access to so many influential accounts could have easily chosen to manipulate the markets through FUD rather than run giveaway scams. Crypto trader Sicarious described the hackers as “super low IQ” and explained a better approach would be to short Bitcoin then blast news about “SEC raids, exchange hacks, funds not being ‘safu’”.Another well known crypto trader DonAlt responded suggesting the same approach could have pumped Bitcoin’s price with the accounts tweeting news of “a coin being adopted as a reserve currency for the US to thwart China and bought beforehand.”Bitcoin skeptic and gold enthusiast Peter Schiff commented on the attack wondering “if this is a harbinger of Bitcoin itself being hacked”, finishing the tweet by saying, “Better to play it safe and just buy #gold.”But as Anthony Pompliano tweeted: “Twitter was hacked. Bitcoin has never been hacked.”Blockstream CEO Adam Back posted a funny tweet about Peter getting hacked and asking for gold instead of Bitcoin: The hackers got Peter. (Someone with a bluecheck mark asked me to post ;) pic.twitter.com/r1IdAH4aNUBitcoin developer Jimmy Song took the opportunity to educate people that nothing centralized is really owned by the individual likening this situation back to fiat currency economies:“You know how someone is messing with Twitter with root level access right now? The same thing happens to the dollar every day. Your dollars aren't really yours in the same way your Twitter isn't really yours.”"
337,"Some of the largest and most influential Twitter accounts in the world were hacked earlier today to promote fake Bitcoin giveaways. But eagle-eyed Reddit users have spotted a series of hidden messages in transactions sent to the Bitcoin wallet at the center of the scam. Prominent accounts targeted in the Twitter attack included Joe Biden, Elon Musk, George Wallace, Bill Gates, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Wiz Khalifa, Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Barack Obama and Jeff Bezos. The accounts were hacked with a message promising that if users sent BTC to a particular address, they would get a 2:1 return. 
According to blockchain data, a user sent 0.00005348 Bitcoin (BTC) — roughly half a dollar in seven different transactions to the BTC wallet associated with the Twitter hack. The yet-to-be-identified sender spent 0.00121639 BTC in transaction fees — $11.19 — to send the following message: Just Read AllTransaction Outputs As TextYou Take Risk When Use BitcoinFor Your Twitter GameBitcoin is TraceableWhy Not MoneroAs of this writing, scammers have conned Twitter users out of 12.86 BTC, or roughly $118,000. It’s unclear whether the message was targeting those responsible for the hack, or for those who fell for the Bitcoin giveaway scam by sending crypto.Monero (XMR) is well known in the crypto community as a coin with more privacy features than Bitcoin, and is considered by many as the token of choice for scammers and darknet activities. Reddit user u/ethereumflow said the message was strategic in that it reached people who use BTC to get them to research some of the differences with XMR: “I doubt anyone that has Monero would fall for this scam but a lot of gullible people have BTC, no disrespect. I’m sure the intention was always to eventually swap for Monero. Questions will be directed at whichever exchange this happens with I’m sure. Is this good press for Monero? I don’t know. But it does advertise the high level of privacy and security.”As of this writing, the price of Monero is $71.04, up 4.66% in the last 24 hours, while BTC remains in the $9,200s."

While the attackers initially concentrated on crypto-native accounts, they expanded to technology leaders including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, and then to celebrities like Kanye West.After ten minutes, the wallet address that was posted on Musk’s account already contained 3.64 Bitcoins, worth $34,498 at the time of writing. Prior to Musk’s account being hacked, the wallet had only received 0.6527 Bitcoins after being posted on the hacked accounts of numerous exchanges.Numerous other accounts within the cryptocurrency space had already been accessed by the apparent hack, including the largest exchanges in the space. Binance and Coinbase have 2.2 million Twitter followers between them, although Musk’s account is an order of magnitude larger, with 36.9 million followers.While the original tweet was soon deleted, a new version popped up again within seconds, suggesting that the attack was ongoing.Felipe Erazo contributed reporting to this story.This is a developing story and will be updated.

340,"The Taproot upgrade represents one of the most significant developments for Bitcoin’s mainchain in recent months. Despite seeing very little controversy, the community is still debating on the proper procedure on how to implement it more than six months after the BIPs were published.The issues stem from the necessity of conducting a soft fork that would be accepted by all relevant stakeholders. According to a Reddit thread pinned in the r/Bitcoin community, “the biggest problem with activating Taproot is PTSD from the previous softfork, SegWit.”SegWit consensus in 2017 followed the BIP9 soft-fork procedure, which required 95% of all miners to signal that they upgraded to the new software and were ready to complete the fork. A time-out period existed that automatically rejected a proposal after consensus hadn’t been reached by a certain date.The very high degree of required agreement meant that a single relatively large miner could stall the upgrade and “hold it hostage.” Allegedly, miner opposition to SegWit was due to “covert AsicBoost,” a mining enhancement technique that the upgrade would have made unusable. However, SegWit was ultimately the culmination of a community debate on block size spanning years, which was mostly resolved with the Bitcoin Cash fork.To avoid similar controversy, two different techniques for Taproot are being proposed.An alternative to BIP-9 is to codify that the upgrade will be activated after the timeout, instead of being rejected. Since this would effectively lock in the decision to fork before its activation, it is seen as a less ideal measure. Instead, a “Modern Softfork Activation” procedure proposes a hybrid system where the upgrade would get rejected after failing to reach consensus in a year. After another six months of discussion, the community could decide to begin a two year-long procedure which would activate the upgrade at expiry. The maximum length for this procedure would be 42 months, or three years and a half. As of right now, the timer is not yet ticking. More than six months have passed since Taproot’s initial formalization as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal in January. Several code improvements have been pushed to it since, though they do not constitute major changes.Taproot improves certain aspects of Bitcoin privacy related to complex spending conditions. It allows hiding the conditions that were not triggered, and can make multisig transactions look indistinguishable from single wallet transfers. The upgrade was previously hyped up, which fueled some misconceptions on its upcoming features. Some believed that it would make the CoinJoin privacy protocol impossible to distinguish from normal transactions, though as Cointelegraph previously reported, CoinJoin is not affected at all in the final version of Taproot.But despite the relatively uncontroversial and limited set of features, Taproot may take months — if not years — to be activated."
341,"Grayscale Investments has just released its quarterly report which shows that institutional demand for Bitcoin and other digital assets is still on the rise despite the lack of action from Bitcoin price (BTC). The report shows that Grayscale had yet another record quarter for its digital asset products with $905.8 million dollars invested over that time period.The nearly $1 billion inflow means Grayscale almost doubled its previous high of $503.7 in the first quarter of 2020. Out of the total amount of funds accrued by Grayscale, Bitcoin continued to lead the pack with 82.92% or $751.1 million invested in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).Institutional investors continue to be the leading demographic of Grayscale’s digital asset trusts. Currently they account for 84% of investment in the second quarter of 2020. However, Grayscale saw a significant increase in new investors which represented 57% of the Grayscale investor base during the quarter. While the percentage of new investors has increased, they only accounted for $124.1 million of the inflow into the Grayscale digital asset products.New Grayscale Investors Q2 2020. Source: GrayscaleWhile new investors made up a large percentage of the investment coming into the Grayscale products, returning institutional investors also expanded into other assets. This is likely due to the record-low volatility currently seen in the Bitcoin price. Currently, around 81% of investors have diversified their portfolio into alternative digital assets. The report reads: “While long volatility was the winning trade in 1Q20, volatility was subdued in 2Q20 as risk assets steadily recovered. In 2Q20, digital assets outperformed most indices, and Zcash, Ethereum, and Stellar led the way returning 72%, 62%, and 62%, respectively.”The Grayscale Ether trust (ETHE) has seen a significant increase in inflows, having received a record-breaking $135.2 million in investment during this quarter. This accounts for around 15% of the total inflow into Grayscale’s investment products, which may be the higher premiums in ETHE and the arbitrage opportunity it creates for institutions and accredited investors. Data also shows that while Bitcoin volumes have been dwindling, Ether’s have been rising."
342,"El Zonte, a village located in El Salvador, was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the community implemented an economic system based in Bitcoin (BTC).According to a report published by Forbes, the community’s BTC-powered economy began to take hold after an anonymous donor gave a multi-year, six-figure donation to El Zonte in early 2019.Residents started to adopt Bitcoin as a local alternative to conventional financial solutions after their tourism sector was decimated by the pandemic.The article details that Bitcoin owners are able to use crypto to pay for anything in the town, including utility bills “and tacos.” Tokens are also apparently being used to acquire school buses.Michael Peterson, who worked with the anonymous donor to distribute the funds, commented on the initiative:“As we injected Bitcoin into the community, we also taught local businesses how to accept it and helped to educate them on the advantages and drawbacks of accepting Bitcoin. There was a lot of resistance among the adults, [it was ] too technical. So we moved on to youth, they picked it up right away. The key is to get them to start transacting right away, then they want to learn more about it, the security of it, and how it works.”In February, Cointelegraph Spanish reported that Bitcoin Beach and Athena Bitcoin installed the first BTC ATM in the village."
343,"The first half of 2020 has been wild for just about everyone in every asset class. In early March, when it became evident that COVID-19 was a seismic event, asset markets across the globe crashed. One important reason was that levered investors suddenly received margin calls and were forced to liquidate assets to satisfy them.When the only thing anybody cares about is cash, there is no such thing as a safe asset or a defensive investment. During the crash, companies rushed to access their revolving credit lines, bolstering cash reserves as quickly as possible in fear that if they didn’t do it today, that credit would be unavailable tomorrow. The bid for risk securities dropped out, and prices started to plummet. Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies were no different than stocks — simply another asset investors were holding that they needed to sell in order to raise United States dollars.Only after the U.S. Federal Reserve poured massive amounts of cash into the banking system did the cash hoarding subside, and shortly thereafter, everyone rushed to put their cash back to work in the financial markets. Crypto markets stabilized and rebounded along with stocks. During this time, both BTC and stocks were experiencing extreme volatility, and this uncertainty was priced into the options markets for both.As markets slowly began to show strength, implied volatility as measured through option prices started to settle as well. One-month annualized forward-looking implied volatility got as high as 80% in the S&P 500 stock index, peaking as high as 180% in BTC at the height of the panic, on March 16. Over the next few weeks, volatility tracked lower and lower, though remained high relative to historical averages.After the craziness at the end of March and beginning of April subsided, traders turned their eyes toward the next thing on the horizon. For BTC, the next big thing was the upcoming halving of mining rewards. There was plenty of speculation on all sides about what would happen when the clock ticked past the fateful hour on May 11. Would prices skyrocket? Crash? Would nothing happen at all? Was it all priced in? No matter which side of the debate investors fell, they could all agree on one thing — the halving might constitute a catalyst for a market move, and it might be worth owning some downside protection or upside exposure to take advantage of it. The fact that this potential event was on the horizon kept option-implied volatility from dropping too quickly, even as realized volatility started to settle down. Essentially, the market seemed to agree that options should have some extra value for the uncertainty of the halving event. Toward the end of April, despite realized volatility settling in the 65%–70% range, implied forward-looking volatility started ticking up as demand for options increased, reaching as high as 95% immediately before the halving.After the halving passed, and proved to be anticlimactic, there was much less of a reason for investors to own options, particularly the shorter dated expiries. The holders of long calls and puts started to close their positions, selling those options to market-makers, and even more of those holders decided to take short positions. As the market-makers started to get longer options in near term expirations, implied volatility was pushed aggressively lower.At the same time, the market-makers were hedging their books as best they could. One of the most common hedging strategies in this scenario is gamma hedging. When a position is long options (whether they are calls or puts, as market-makers can easily hedge the first order sensitivity to underlying price), and especially with nearer-dated options, the position has positive gamma or positive convexity. That is, the risk profile looks longer and longer as the underlying asset rises, and shorter and shorter as the underlying asset falls. In this case, in order to balance that risk, market-makers had lots of BTC to sell every time BTC rallied, and lots of BTC to buy every time BTC sold off.This action of hedging gamma can lead to a positive feedback loop between implied and realized volatility. As realized volatility drops, investors get comfortable because they do not anticipate anything crazy happening in the market in the near term and become more willing to sell options. As they sell more and more options, market-makers accumulate long gamma positions and subsequently lower implied volatility in their pricing models. They also actively hedge this long gamma position, selling BTC when it is up and buying when it is down. This act of gamma hedging, in the absence of other external factors (such as big news or a large influx of investors jumping into or out of the crypto markets), creates a dampening effect on volatility. This cycle continues, pushing the front of the implied volatility term structure continually lower while simultaneously creating upside resistance and downside support for BTC prices.We have seen this effect play out substantially since the end of May. Realized volatility has dropped to under 30%, near multiyear lows despite the objectively uncertain world in which we are currently living. Yet even just slightly longer-dated implied volatilities, in the three-to-six month range, are still priced close to the historical long term average, in the 60%–70% volatility range. Either the current low volatility feedback loop environment will come to an end soon, or perhaps there are some savvy trades to make in order to take advantage of the disconnect in implied volatilities over the next few months.This is part one of a two-part series on Bitcoin volatility — read part two on some common trading strategies here.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

344,"Since early May, the price of Bitcoin has been at a standstill in a tight range between $8,500 and $10,000. For most of the past month, BTC has remained between $9,000 and $9,500 as realized volatility hit a three-year low.According to Skew, the volatility of Bitcoin has dropped to levels unseen since 2017. Researchers at Skew wrote: “#bitcoin realized volatility on a three years low, Tesla is eating Bitcoin’s lunch!”The realized volatility of Bitcoin hits a three-year-low. Source: Skew.comThe multiyear low level of volatility amid strong rallies of altcoins prompted expectations of a large price movement. In recent weeks, altcoins such as Chainlink (LINK), Tezos (XTZ) and Cardano (ADA) outperformed both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). LINK, for example, achieved a new all-time high in the second week of July, despite the stagnant crypto market.Based on the increase in appetite for cryptocurrencies with low market capitalizations, traders generally expect Bitcoin to see a spike in volatility. Skew data shows that major Bitcoin futures exchanges such as Bybit have seen a gradual increase in open interest.The term open interest refers to the total amount of long and short contracts open in the futures market. The open interest of BitMEX and Bybit rising to $650 million and $500 million, respectively, indicates futures traders anticipate volatility soon. As various metrics point toward a decisive Bitcoin price movement, four key macro indicators suggest an uptrend. Many fundamental factors align with a bullish Bitcoin sentiment. Source: GlassnodeData from Blockchain.com shows the hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain network hit a new record high on July 8, reaching 125.99 million terahashes per second. It surpassed the previous all-time high set in the first week of March, moments before BTC fell below $3,600 on Black Thursday.The hash rate of Bitcoin surging to a new high so quickly after the block reward halving on May 11 carries weight. A halving typically leads to a substantial decline in hash rate because it overnight cuts in half the amount of BTC that miners can mine. After a halving, miners mine less BTC and generate less revenue, but their cost of mining remains the same. As such, analysts anticipated the hash rate would drop for a relatively long period throughout 2020.Indeed, after the halving, the hash rate dropped to as low as 90.29 million TH/s. Within less than two months, it hit a new peak, indicating that the mining sector remains healthy and the probability of a death spiral is extremely low.Bitcoin blockchain network hash rate hits an all-time high. Source: Blockchain.comA death spiral phenomenon, which occurs when the majority of miners in the Bitcoin network stop mining altogether, was also feared to be in the cards. Theoretically, a death spiral could occur if mining becomes largely unprofitable within a short period.But possibly due to the rainy season in Sichuan, China that has decreased electricity costs, miners have recovered rapidly from the halving, reducing the likelihood of a sudden sell-off, which might drop the selling pressure on Bitcoin.According to a chart published by Bitcoin trader “Nunya Bizniz,” the price of BTC historically saw extended ranges after a halving, which have led to substantial rallies in the past.Currently, Bitcoin is entering its 10th week in a tight range. It saw a six-week range and a 15-week range in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Both ranges led to significant rallies within a few months. Nunya Bizniz wrote: “Bitcoin being Bitcoin. Sideways price action after the halving is the norm, as BTC now enters its 10th week in a tight range. When rocket?”An extended tight range is considered to be an optimistic trend because it builds up a foundation for a stronger rally. When BTC rallies on the back of a short-lived range, it could leave it vulnerable to a steep correction.On July 13, Charles Edwards, digital asset manager at Capriole, reported that the highly anticipated Hash Ribbons buy signal was confirmed. Edwards, who created the indicator, wrote in a tweet: “#Bitcoin Hash Ribbons ‘Buy’ signal just confirmed. The post-Halving signal is particularly special. It will probably be a very long time until the next occurs. ...and so the great bull run begins.”The Hash Ribbons indicator spots the low point of Bitcoin by predicting a potential miner capitulation through the evaluation of the hash rate. The indicator is based on a theory that BTC tends to bottom out after miners sell-off, or after the hash rate of BTC reaches a low point. Both the record-high hash rate of Bitcoin and the Hash Ribbon buy signal indicate miners have already gone through a sell-off phase.The “HODLwave” chart created by cryptocurrency investor Willy Woo demonstrates an increase in newfound demand for Bitcoin. The lower HODLwaves tend to increase during a market bottom because new money enters the market. On his website, Woo explains the model: “The upper contours, represent supply (old coins that have remained unmoved) while the lower contours represent new demand (coins that have recently shifted). The composite view clearly shows each bull cycle bringing in new demand.”HODLwaves indicate an inflow of new capital into the Bitcoin market. Source: Woobull.comVarious data points suggest that long-time investors in Bitcoin are increasingly holding onto BTC as the market sees a consistent inflow of new investors. The data indicates that BTC could be in an accumulation phase, wherein existing and new investors foresee a long-term bull market.Alistair Milne, chief investment officer of Altana Digital Currency Fund, suggested that HODLing activity indicates a bullish Bitcoin trend. Likewise, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, chief technical officer of on-chain market analysis firm Glassnode, agrees based on on-chain data points:“BTC supply not moved in over a year: 62%. BTC supply in a state of profit: 77%. Read: Many investors could be profitably cashing out, but instead choose to hodl. How can you not be bullish on #Bitcoin?”Researchers at Glassnode found that external market forces are seemingly slowing Bitcoin’s uptrend, as Liesl Eichholz, who is responsible for growth strategy at the company, wrote in a newsletter: “External market forces such as systemic uncertainty and unknown correlations with traditional markets may prevent BTC from breaking out at this stage, but signals remain strong nonetheless.”As Cointelegraph reported on July 15, technical indicators suggest that the United States stock market rally is overheated. If equities drop, considering the recent correlation between Bitcoin and equities, BTC could become increasingly vulnerable to a near-term correction.There is an external risk that a potential pullback in the U.S. stock market could cause the appetite for risk-on assets to drop. But a confluence of record-high hash rate, rising HODLing activity, the Hash Ribbons buy signal and historical Bitcoin price patterns have many investors optimistic heading into the fourth quarter of 2020."
345,"Bitcoin (BTC) set another dubious record on July 15 as realized volatility sank to its lowest in three years.According to data from on-chain analytics resource Skew, 30-day realized volatility recorded its smallest reading since 2017 this week.Realized volatility refers to volatility as defined by various timespans. Low volatility tends to concern traders and analysts, particularly over extended periods, as a kickback is all too often triggered afterward.Earlier this month, 10-day realized volatility hit 20%, its lowest since the period immediately before BTC/USD crashed to $3,100 in December 2018.As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, trading volumes were also down at the time, fuelling expectations that volatility would soon return to the market.Since then, Bitcoin’s anticipated “big move” has yet to appear, with a trading corridor between $9,000 and $9,500 remaining in place.BTC/USD realized volatility comparison. Source: Skew/ TwitterFor Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb, however, there was plenty of potential for a major correction towards $8,000. Specifically, he told subscribers of his Telegram trading channel on Tuesday, the 20-week moving average (MA) at $8,200 provided a realistic support level. Alternatively, BTC should reclaim its 50-day moving average, currently close to $9,400.“Overall my position remains very cautious,” he summarized. “Until then it’s just sideways chop until proven otherwise so I'm happy to sit that out and wait for confirmation.”In the meantime, Bitcoin is providing little inspiration, with even Tesla stock beating it on volatility. “#Bitcoin realized volatility on a three years low, Tesla is eating bitcoin's lunch!” Skew commented. Tesla has surprised by posting multiple new highs despite multiple calls for a massive correction continuing for several months. Since its recent bottom on March 18, $TSLA has gained over 300% to trade at $1,516 at press time. Even at $1,200, Tesla’s market cap was over 30% larger than Bitcoin’s.Tesla stock price eight-month chart.

346,"The TD9 sell indicator emerged on the S&P 500 chart across various time frames. Considering the heightened level of correlation between Bitcoin and stocks, it might hint at a short-term Bitcoin (BTC) price pullback.But cryptocurrency traders seemingly remain unfazed by the vulnerability of stocks. Several traders anticipate Bitcoin to rally toward the mid-$9,000s despite the TD9 signaling for a correction.A TD9 sell signal is an indicator part of the widely-cited TD Sequential system. It spots a potential trend reversal by identifying overextended corrections or rallies.A TD9 buy or sell signal appears when nine consecutive candles are higher than the four candles prior. As an example, let’s assume the price of Bitcoin opened at $10,000 on a daily chart at the start of a month. If BTC closes above $10,000 for the next 13 days, a TD9 sell signal would confirm.Typically, a 13-day rally with barely any pullback leads to the confirmation of a TD9 sell signal across many time frames. This week, a pseudonymous trader known as Fomocap said that the signal emerged on the daily, 12-hour and 6-hour S&P 500 charts. The trader said:“TD9 signal confirmed on SPX: 1. D SPX 2. Multiframe: 24h, 12h, 6h.”The TD9 sell signal appears on the S&P 500 chart. Source: FomocapData from Skew meanwhile shows that the price of Bitcoin has demonstrated a relatively high level of correlation with stocks since March. As such, if the stock market falls in the near-term, it could affect the sentiment around Bitcoin.However, the trader emphasized that the accuracy of the TD9 signal is debated because it can give false signals. In a bull market, for instance, the price of Bitcoin or U.S. stocks can continuously see uptrends without major pullbacks. In that case, the TD Sequential system could become less effective. The trader said:“It’s one of many PA patterns. Yes, basically momentum. TD9 gives lots of false signals too. Better to collect all data, angles, views then stuck in own imagination paradigm. Just to keep on radar, no blindly following.”At the same time, according to market analyst Michael van de Poppe, the uptrend of Bitcoin remains intact due to resilience at a strong support area.Bitcoin has remained above $9,200 for the majority of the past two months. BTC saw brief drops below $9,000, but the top cryptocurrency recovered quickly.Bitcoin price chart with a potential fractal upwards. Source: Crypto MichaelIf BTC continues to defend the $9,200 level and breaks out above $9,300, van de Poppe noted that a rally to above $9,600 is likely. He said:“So far, so good. Support holding, the massive crash didn’t occur. If we break $9,300, I think $9,600 is a likely target short term.”Bitcoin trader Zoran Kole also suggested that the chances of the Bitcoin uptrend continuing to the mid-$9,000s remain high."
347,"Darrell “Bubba” Wallace, the only African American driver in NASCAR's top racing series, will now be flying around the track in a car adorned with the Bitcoin logo.According to a tweet posted by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on July 14, the NASCAR driver’s new paint job has at least two Bitcoin (BTC) logos along with logos for Square's Cash App. Dorsey is the CEO and co-founder of Square.#bitcoin @BubbaWallace pic.twitter.com/tNSio3qnTzWallace has come into the national spotlight outside of racing after reports last month he pushed NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag from its events. He also made headlines after discovering what looked to be a noose in his team garage, although later reports suggested it was simply a door pull rope. President Donald Trump took aim at the driver with an inflammatory Tweet suggesting  Wallace’s actions had caused NASCAR’s ratings to plummet. In fact the ratings on FOX are up 8% since the controversy.Reaction to the Cash App sponsorship and Bitcoin logo on Wallace’s car seemed positive, with some social media users predicting the arrangement could lead to bullish trends.Reddit user degentrader69 said the price of Bitcoin would likely rise to $100,000 by the end of the week as a result of the partnership. Twitter user newmoneyFC suggested that if Trump tweeted about Wallace again, there could be BTC protest buys, pushing the price to $20,000."
348,"The growing tokenization of Bitcoin and the emergence of yield farming has propelled the growth of the decentralized finance sector over the past three months according to ConsenSys.The second quarter report into Ethereum-based DeFi emphasizes the significance of the total number of tokenized BTC overtaking the sum of BTC on Bitcoin’s own layer 2 scaling solution, Lightning Network.Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) represents more than two-thirds of the tokenized BTC on Ethereum, but the report notes there has been a recent proliferation of Bitcoin tokenization protocols. Around 3,000 of more than 11,000 BTC on Ethereum was tokenized through renBTC, sBTC, imBTC, and hBTC.“Cross-chain interoperability is anti-maximalist, but is more likely the future of blockchain,” the report asserts.The report also notes the increasing popularity of ‘yield farming’ — the generation of passive returns through systematic lending of crypto assets across various DeFi protocols.The launch of Compound’s governance token in June was a major catalyst that sparked increased interest in yield farming, with daily active DeFi users and the sum of Ether locked in DeFI protocols surging late in the month.However, ConsenSys’ data indicates that the popularity of yield farming has failed to attract large numbers of new users from outside of the DeFi sector, with nearly 2,000 ‘super users’ representing a large share of activity in the space.The report highlighted major security incidents targeting DeFi platforms Uniswap, Lendf.me, and Bancor. On April 18, $340,000 was stolen from Uniswap through a reentrancy attack vector that compromised Tokenlon’s ERC-777 token that underpins its imBTC protocol. The following day saw $25 million stolen from Lenf.me after a similar attack, however, the funds were returned after the hacker accidentally leaked their IP address which resulted in subsequent negotiations between the platform and its attacker.On June 28, Balancer suffered a loss of roughly $450,000 when a hacker exploited an incompatibility between ERC-20 ‘deflationary tokens’ STA and STONK and Balancer’s underlying smart contract.Collectively, the three attacks resulted in over $26 million being stolen, however, the majority of the funds were returned after the funds stolen from Lendf.me were returned.“Security incidents are inevitable in emerging technology,” ConsenSys concluded, noting that “the DeFi community continues to develop strategies to hedge against it.”"
349,"Notorious political lobbyist Jack Abramoff has pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to defraud investors, conspiring to commit wire fraud, and violations of the Lobbying Disclosure Act relating to the 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) for AML BitCoin.Abramoff pleaded guilty by telephone on July 14, admitting to having defrauded millions from investors through the ICO. The plea marks the first prosecution of a lobbyist for a criminal violation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act.AML BitCoin’s founder Rowland Marcus Andrade is currently fighting criminal charges relating to the crypto offering, having entered a plea of not guilty on July 8.Abramoff was hired by Andrade to develop a public relations and marketing campaign for the ICO, through which he admits to distributing false and misleading information regarding the technical capabilities and development of the crypto asset.Prosecutors assert that Abramoff and Andrade took in $5.6 million from more than 2,400 investors through their Nevada-based National AtenCoin Foundation, or NAC — the entity through which the ICO was conducted.Around July 2017, NAC began issuing tokens to purportedly raise funds for the development of AML BitCoin — promising investors that the tokens would be exchangeable for AML BitCoins when the coin launched within six months.AML BitCoin was promoted on social platforms and forums as a superior version of Bitcoin (BTC) that offered integrated protections against money-laundering, terrorist financing, and theft risks, according to a parallel investigation launched by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC noted that none of the touted capabilities existed.While working for AML BitCoin, Abramoff was also found to have lobbied a sitting member of Congress on behalf of a Californian cannabis company despite not being a registered lobbyist. Prosecutors assert that Abramoff also lobbied a member of congress on behalf of an undercover FBI agent posing as a businessperson during the same period.Abramoff rose to prominence as a conservative lobbyist during the 1990s, and was sentenced to prison in 2006 after pleading guilty to felony counts relating to illicit lobbying practices."
350,"Millionaire philanthropist Bill Pulte has given away close to $150,000 this year in an attempt to promote the mass adoption of cryptocurrency. However, some critics are concerned that he may inadvertently be providing legitimacy to the masses of scammers who use fake giveaways to con new users out of crypto.Others believe it’s a ‘self serving’ attempt to build his public profile. Pulte has nearly 3,000,000 Twitter followers, up from the 10,000 he had in July 2019.In a July 9 post on Pulte’s Twitter account, the millionaire said he would be donating funds through CashApp to users who retweet or comment on his posts. By the following day he had given away $625 to six of his followers to buy Bitcoin (BTC). According to Pulte, the donations must be used to purchase the cryptocurrency because it “will be higher in the future.”I will be sending money to some of you tonight for you to buy Bitcoin in CashApp. You have to keep it in Bitcoin because I think Bitcoin will be higher in the future. Deal? Names will be herehttps://t.co/2yeSE6Nly0In total, Pulte has given away $5625 so far this month and more than $18,000 last month. Many of Pulte’s gifts over the last several months have been in cash — and free cars for some — but the millionaire has come out in favor of giving away crypto as a means to “strong arm more adoption.”“The crypto community is missing out big time. If they want mass adoption, they got to give it out on Twitter and social media [...] Cryptocurrency can help the world’s poorest, especially those who are ‘unbanked.’ As a philanthropist, I therefore want to promote adoption.”Pulte keeps an active list of all the recipients of his offers, with gifts reportedly ranging from $10 to $15,000 this year. As the grandson of billionaire William John Pulte, he inherited at least part of his grandfather’s estate. As of December 2019, Pulte claims to own 11 BTC — now valued at more than $100,000.Pulte’s giveaways seem genuine — he has a verified account, hasn’t been shy about accepting interviews, and has the endorsement of Donald Trump and high-profile YouTubers. However, nearly everyone who has ever been involved in cryptocurrency has probably seen a scam involving free giveaways, and social media like Twitter is usually the gateway. The ‘giveaway’ usually entails the user sending a small amount of cryptocurrency to ‘verify their address’ in order to get a much larger amount back. Of course, they never receive any crypto. According to Ilia Rozhnov, head of the Brand Protection team in the Asia-Pacific region at Group-IB, a cybersecurity company, fake crypto giveaways are “among fraudsters’ favorite tricks.” Group-IB has observed the dangers of scammers exploiting legitimate giveaways. “Fake giveaways affect heavily the reputation of brands and celebrities whose names are being hijacked by scammers,” he said. “It’s essential for brand owners to constantly monitor for and block any online infringements abusing their names.”Rozhnov’s team detected one notable example in 2018, when a fake Twitter account pretending to be Telegram founder Pavel Durov announced a fake crypto giveaway as a reply to a legitimate Tweet about a power outage at Telegram. According to Group-IB, the fraudsters scammed users out of $59,500 in a matter of hours.Pulte is giving away cash to his followers to buy BTC, which means someone could bilk unsuspecting desperate people out of much more by pretending to be him. Cointelegraph has reported crypto fraudsters walked away with roughly $24 million in 2020 alone. Several scammers have impersonated SpaceX’s Elon Musk  and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.Cameron LeBlanc from Fatherly said Pulte’s actions appeared to be less about “Twitter philanthropy” as he claims, and more about image:“On its face, it seems kind of nice, a guy with a lot giving to those with a little. But when you think about it and look at how Pulte is going about it, the entire enterprise is depressing. It comes down to a guy who, through an accident of birth, inherited a bunch of money dangling it in front of people who didn’t, a self-serving effort to build a public profile around sentiment instead of real impact.”Cointelegraph has contacted Bill Pulte for comment and will update this story if we hear back."

352,"Stablecoins have never had more buying power than now, this could bode well for the next bull run.Glassnode keeps track of the Stablecoin Supply Ratio, or SSR, which is calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s (BTC) market capitalization by the market capitalization of all major stablecoins. Low SSR indicates that stablecoins have more buying power, which the company asserts could be interpreted as a bullish sign.SSR = BTC Market Cap / Stablecoin Market CapSSR, Bitcoin price and market capitalization. Source: GlassnodeThis ratio currently stands at just above 15, meaning that, in theory, stablecoins could buy approximately one fifteenth of all Bitcoin. For reference, back in March 2018, this ratio stood at 88. Thus, in just over two years the stablecoin buying power increased more than sixfold. Since the ratio has two components, which is to “blame” for this drastic change? — Looking at the chart, it becomes very clear that the radical change is mostly due to the growth of stablecoins. The market capitalization of BTC at the time was $195 billion, currently, it stands at $171 billion, this represents a decrease of 12%. Meanwhile, the cap for stablecoins has increased from $2.2 billion to $11 billion or 500% growth.Stablecoins represent a convenience vehicle for traders and investors. It allows them to park their crypto assets in stable assets without the need to cash out and exit the crypto ecosystem. A recent study found that exchanges that support BTC-USDT pairs record more “whale” trades than the ones that support BTC-USD pairs.Although the market capitalization of stablecoins has been increasing rapidly, the price of BTC has not kept pace. The correlation between the SSR and Bitcoin price appears to have broken down around Black Thursday. Whether the growth of stablecoins will transform into the next bull run remains to be seen. However, if and when this run happens, the maturity of the stablecoin space should provide more efficient mechanisms for market participants."
353,"The world is eagerly waiting for a next-generation, high-performance, permissionless blockchain, and this blockchain should be able to industrially scale all decentralized applications. So far, the crypto community has witnessed:Sharding mechanisms give hope for unlimited, sustainable scalability of blockchains, but many people in the blockchain space strongly believe that the scalability or sharding has reached a tipping point — but that is not quite true. Let’s dive into it. Currently, the internet is used in payments, Internet of Things, smart cities, robotics, web searches, streaming videos, e-commerce, autonomous vehicles, etc. Hence, the internet generates:This work needs to be harmoniously split among all the peers in a P2P network. This splitting of work is called sharding technology. Sharding can be applied to transactions, computations and storage.A permissionless P2P network is unpredictable, and to compensate for this unpredictability, various blockchain protocols fix the number of validations and the number of storage copies to a constant that is derived from a mathematical computation based on certain assumptions. This limits the scalability of blockchains, as the system will either overcompensate and limit scale or undercompensate and risk security/integrity.What if the P2P network can be predicted? Can the number of validation and storage peers be flexible depending on the chaoticity of the P2P network? That is to say, if the P2P network behaves ideally, then only one validation and storage copy is needed, and if the peers in the P2P network behave maliciously or deviate from the ideal nature, then the number of validation and storage copies will increase proportionally.Problems faced by peers/shards in a P2P network include:The culprit here is the unpredictability of P2P networks! This decreases the performance of validation, computation and storage.Due to the uncertainty in P2P networks, a self-healing mechanism is introduced.Case one: Traditional blockchains. All the N nodes in the network validate/compute/store all the transactions in the network. (N)Case two: Ideal P2P. Consider an ideal P2P blockchain network where all the peers in the network are available 24/7 with good internet, bandwidth, electricity supply, etc., and are good peers that are not malicious. Then any transaction/computation/storage that arrives at the network can be validated/computed/stored by one peer. (1)Case three: Sharded blockchains. A real P2P blockchain network is not so ideal, and hence a mathematical formula is derived based on the maximum possible deviation from the ideal P2P blockchain network and certain assumptions to set a fixed number, such as 22–600 peers, to validate/compute/store, depending on the blockchain protocol. (N/x)Case four: Self-healing blockchains. Cases one, two and three are extreme scenarios, as shown in the graph below. The number of transactions/computation/storage should depend on the level of deviation from the ideal state (with an adequate safety margin). (N/x(c)), where (c) stands for the chaoticity of the network. Chaoticity (c) of the network is a function of internet bandwidth, electricity, data availability, data consistency and the number of nodes joining or leaving. If there is any change in the function compared with the ideal state, whether positive or negative, countermeasures are deployed accordingly by the P2P network. Hence, the network automatically heals if there is any stress on it.Let us use the Paris subway as an example, where depending on the traffic of people, the metro trains change their timing, frequency, number of compartments and speed. Self-healing blockchains are designed in such a way that they can survive for decades, if not centuries. The scalability achieved by these types of blockchains are close to centralized systems, yet they maintain true decentralization. Because there is high scalability, any centralized application can be built on self-healing blockchains.Applying artificial intelligence to the time series — internet bandwidth, electricity, data availability, data consistency, data loss, number of nodes joining/leaving, etc. — could further improve self-healing blockchains, making them faster and able to predict an event before it happens and, hence, able to deploy countermeasures before it occurs.

354,"Peer-to-peer Bitcoin (BTC) marketplace Paxful announced on July 14 that its platform has witnessed another surge in trade volume, hitting the $4.6 billion mark and reaching over 4.5 million wallet registrations.Paxful is also forecasting an additional two million users by the end of 2020, as the company is entering its 5th anniversary.Ray Youseff, the CEO of Paxful, noted that emerging markets in developing nations are a major factor in the platform's recent growth. He said, ""When you look at our data, in Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya lead in terms of volume this year. Coming in fourth, and surprisingly one breakout country we’ve seen is Cameroon where we have $5M USD in volume (YTD 2020).""Youseff said that Paxful has seen a significant uptick in the Indian crypto market since 2019, with trade volume increasing by 883% from $2.2 million to $22.1 million in 2020.The CEO also stated that the worldwide coronavirus pandemic has had some effect on the platform's growth. Investors have become more interested in non-traditional assets to protect their wealth as COVID-19 related closures rocked global markets.  He said, ""In terms of the COVID-19 pandemic, while it has impacted usage of cryptocurrencies on our platform and more specifically the interest in a nontraditional monetary asset, we believe that the continued growth is more a result of the financial inequality that continues to plague the world.”Cointelegraph reported on June 11 that P2P Bitcoin trading activity in the United States surged to a new all-time high during the week of June 7."
355,"BitGo, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin (BTC) transaction processors, is integrating a new API into its crypto wallet service to support the Financial Action Task Force’s travel rule.BitGo told Cointelegraph on July 14 that the company is the first wallet service to provide an in-house API solution for the FATF’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, known as the ""travel rule.""Specifically, BitGo is now extending its API endpoints to enable its clients to transfer additional transaction-related data required under the new rule. Intended to provide more transparency, the new tool is expected to enable the exchange of data about transaction originators and beneficiaries as well as establish BitGo as a compliant Virtual Asset Service Provider, or VASP.Chris Metcalfe, senior product manager at BitGo, told Cointelegraph that BitGo’s API now accepts a subset of InterVASP’s IVMS101 standard. Released by InterVASP in May 2020, the new standard enables a universal common language for communication of required originator and beneficiary data between VASPs.Metcalfe said that the rollout of extended APIs means that BitGo’s API is ready to start receiving and recording the necessary data. BitGo clients now have the option to check out this feature by submitting this additional data in their transaction requests to the BitGo platform. Metcalfe noted that the API integration is currently offered to clients on a voluntary basis.Metcalfe noted that BitGo clients are already familiar with API tools, adding, “The integration effort required by our clients is relatively light, as they simply need to append slightly more information about the sender in the transaction requests they are already making.”As part of the development, the extended API will transfer data involving transactions greater than one thousand dollars, as required by the travel rule. BitGo’s Metcalfe clarified that a VASP would not be required to submit travel data for multiple transactions below $1,000.According to Metcalfe, BitGo has not been “too involved with FATF directly” regarding the development, but has been collaborating on travel rule solutions with a number of working groups and regulators for about a year.The so-called “travel rule” represents a set of FATF guidelines for crypto-related firms to adopt a number of AML and Know Your Customer measures. Introduced by the FATF in June 2019, the travel rule aims to prevent criminal and terrorist misuse of virtual assets.While the travel rule’s hard deadline came in June 2020, Siân Jones, a convener of the Joint Working Group for InterVASP Messaging Standards, said that this deadline was “a bit of a myth,” adding that it may take years for 200 nations to adapt the FATF’s requirements in their entirety."
356,"Binance’s highly-anticipated cryptocurrency debit card, Binance Card, is officially debuting in countries of the European Economic Area, or EEA.Binance told Cointelegraph on July 14 that EEA-based users will be able to apply for a Binance Card starting in August. While the United Kingdom will follow in the near future, users in other regions are invited to “register their interest” via the Binance Card website, the firm said.As previously reported, Swipe is currently available in 31 countries within the EEA, including countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, among others. Swipe is not yet available in the United States, but the firm is purportedly planning to release the service soon after completing appropriate licensing and registrations.According to the announcement, Binance Card will support a total of four cryptocurrencies at the launch. Those cryptos include Bitcoin (BTC), Swipe’s native SXP token, as well as Binance’s native token BNB and stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD).According to the announcement, the Binance Card rollout will allow users to instantly convert the cryptos to fiat and spend them at over 60 million merchants across 200 regions and territories. Binance emphasized that the Binance Card will basically work like a traditional debit card and will not require users to manually convert crypto to fiat before making a purchase.Binance Card users will be able to recharge their card wallet directly from their spot wallet on Binance as well as choose the order of preference to debit their BTC, BNB, SXP and BUSD assets. Swipe CEO Joselito Lizarondo explained, ""For example, if I have 50 euros in BTC and 50 euros in BNB, if I made a transaction for 75 euros, it would be approved and then it would deduct my crypto in the order I selected."" The Swipe platform will enable users to store their cryptocurrency on their card wallet and only convert them to fiat currencies when a transaction is taking place.Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that Binance Card will greatly contribute to the adoption of crypto around the world:“By providing a tangible way to transact, convert and spend crypto for everyday use, we are furthering our mission of making crypto more accessible to the masses. Giving users the ability to convert and spend their crypto directly with merchants around the world, will make the crypt experience more seamless and applicable.”Last week, Zhao demonstrated the first Binance Card transactions, officially confirming that Binance Card will be powered by Swipe. Binance acquired Swipe just earlier this month, marking its second acquisition this year."
357,"Ether (ETH) is trading at its highest since before the March coronavirus crash, but data suggests that investors have little interest in holding the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Uploading findings using on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode on July 10, one trader noticed that Ether exchange balances remain high, while Bitcoin (BTC) balances have dropped considerably.According to the unverified data, since March, ETH balances on exchanges have continued to trend upward overall. At the same time, BTC has been leaving exchanges en masse over the past three months. “Ever since the Black Thursday crash, Bitcoin balances on crypto exchanges have been falling quite fast. On the other hand, Ethereum exchange balances continue to remain relatively stable,” the trader summarized.The phenomenon could have several implications. Coins on exchanges are more vulnerable but quicker to trade, suggesting that owners store them there to sell at short notice.As Cointelegraph reported previously, BTC traders have shown a preference for saving in recent months, rather than selling or trading.On Ethereum, the network for which Ether is the native token, the current DeFi trend may also be influencing investors. The decentralized finance sector has sparked a token boom and associated trading, and as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, ETH is required for transactions.ETH would make a suitable “home” asset for DeFi traders given its recent low volatility in the run-up to its fifth birthday.ETH, BTC exchange balance comparison.

ETH once traded at almost $1,400, but has failed to recapture more than 20% of those levels since. BTC, on the other hand, currently sits at around 50% of its all-time highs."
358,"Bitcoin (BTC) has succeeded in trolling infamous skeptic Peter Schiff as another attempt to discredit investors falls flat.In a fresh Twitter survey on July 14, Schiff asked how long BTC/USD should trade at four figures or less for investors to sell their coins.With 18 hours left to run at press time, more than 13,000 people had responded to Schiff, who is now well known for his lack of belief in Bitcoin.“This quiz is for Bitcoin HODLers,” he said, addressing his target audience. “How much longer does the price of #Bitcoin have to stay below $10,000 before you will throw in the towel and sell?”Schiff offered four options: one year, three years, 10 years and until the investor dies. Of those who replied, “I’m taking it to my grave” was easily the most popular choice, with 58% of the vote.The result, likely not the one that Schiff was looking for, echoes his previous Bitcoin survey, which pitted BTC against gold. Then, respondents decided that both BTC/USD and XAU/USD would continue gaining as the latter hit nine-year highs of $1,800.Peter Schiff’s latest Twitter survey. Source: TwitterTwitter surveys are by their very nature unreliable, given their lack of curation and vulnerability to bias. For example, Bitcoiners could well have chosen their preferred option to prove a point to Schiff. Schiff himself is also not above suspicion regarding his motives. Despite constantly lambasting Bitcoin, he owns a small allocation and was vocally disappointed when he temporarily lost his wallet password, making the effort to ensure he regained access.In the still-raging battle of Bitcoin versus gold, Schiff may also be using Bitcoin to drum up footfall for his gold company, SchiffGold, from investors looking for a safe haven asset.Not everyone is convinced that the two assets share a level playing field. This week, Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, said in an interview that he believed gold stalwarts would be “phased out” as cryptocurrency took center stage."
359,"Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, said that investments in real estate and gold may not be the future of finance as cryptocurrency comes into focus.In a July 8 interview with Bitcoin bull Anthony Pompliano on Kiyosaki’s radio show, the author said traditional investments like gold and real estate would come second to crypto.“As an old guy, it’s taken me a while to get onto [cryptocurrency], but now I’m buying it,” Kiyosaki said. The author has predicted that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) will reach $75,000 within three years.“I think it’s important, especially for old guys like me, to understand the crypto world because that’s the world that’s coming into view right now and us real estate and gold guys are being phased out.”Kiyosaki’s prediction comes as gold reached its highest price in nearly a decade on July 9, breaking $1,800. Economic fears over the pandemic and concerns about possible inflation as the Fed continues to print money have led many investors to look for alternatives.Cointelegraph reported that major Bitcoin bulls like Michael Novogratz have recommended against putting the majority of one’s funds into crypto:“My sense is that Bitcoin way outperforms gold, but I would tell people to have a lot less Bitcoin than they have gold, just because of the volatility.”At the time of writing, gold trades at $1,799, down roughly 0.23% over the last 24 hours. The price of BTC is $9,223, dropping 0.53% in the same time period."

The site sold oxycodone and a number of other drugs.His supplier, Hyrum Wilson, is the owner of a store called Hyrum’s Family Value Pharmacy. The two were found to have conspired to firebomb a competing Nebraskan pharmacy, though the two men were arrested before the attack could take place.The U.S. Attorney's Office also accused the men of laundering over $1 million in profits. The men allegedly acquired Bitcoin (BTC), sent wire transfers, and transported bundles of cash through the mail.G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said:“Those potentially deadly plans were successfully thwarted during the early stages of the pandemic. This case highlights elements of EDVA’s national security, narcotics, cyber, financial, and violent crime work, all of which can only be performed with the tenacity and skilled investigative efforts demonstrated by our law enforcement partners.”KSNB Local 4 reported that authorities raided Burgamy’s home and found eight loaded weapons, text messages showing proof that they were preparing the firebomb attack, and a list of needed equipment like body armor, weapons, bottles, and lighter fluid.Wilson and Burgamy were charged with drug trafficking, money laundering, and conspiracy to use explosives. Each of the counts carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison. Both men are expected to be sentenced in November.Recently, two Nigerians jetsetters were extradited from Dubai to the United States for a number of alleged crimes.

361,"For many investors crypto trading remains a rags-to-riches affair where inexperienced investors hope to strike it rich by buying the cheapest priced altcoins like many novice traders did in 2017.Currently, the majority of traders do not expect Bitcoin (BTC) to pump 50% or more in a single week as $18,400 seems rather infeasible. On the other hand, many of these same investors are willing to put their hard-earned funds behind a lower cap, cheaper altcoins with the hopes that buying cheaper cryptocurrencies will lead to a higher return.A quick review of CoinMarketCap's index shows that 39 coins out of the top 60 were priced below $3 on July 12. Despite this, investors looking to make a quick return from the cheapest coins should think about the odds of picking winners.As previous years have shown, altcoins can gain relevance even when cryptocurrency markets remain reasonably stable by increasing their market share. These periods are commonly known as an altcoin season, and they can span from a few days to a couple of months.There isn't a clear definition of an altcoin season, although it typically involves a significant drop in Bitcoin dominance. A mere 3% reduction on the Bitcoin dominance chart entices $8 billion in valuation, shifting to the alternative cryptocurrencies' $100 billion market cap.By analyzing 15-day periods over the past year, one can find those moments of altcoin euphoria, which tend to happen either on bullish or neutral cryptocurrency trends.As Bitcoin loses significant support levels or face bearish trends, investors tend to avoid risk on altcoins, causing BTC dominance to increase.These four occasions leave a clear mark and the recent 2.2% drop to the current 63.8% dominance on July 11 came out close. Listed below are the highest BTC dominance drops in 15-day periods.Bitcoin dominance changes over 15-day periods. Source: CointelegraphBitcoin share on total market capitalization (dominance).

Founders can arbitrarily decide between thousands and billions of potential coins in circulation, thereby impacting its unitary price.2020 started strong for Bitcoin, moving to $9,330 level after a 30% run in January.

The early February $109.4 billion peak clearly stands out, marking the highest level since July 2019.In early September 2019, Bitcoin was holding relatively steady at the $10,300 level, recovering from a sub-10K dump. For some reason investors decided to increase their exposure in altcoins, causing BTC dominance to drop 3.5%.This could have been a technical adjustment as BTC dominance had increased to 73%, reaching its highest level since July 2017. Either way, investors signaled that they were more interested in altcoins at that moment, causing a 14.4% rally over the 15 day day period.Worst performers among the sub-$3 coins. Source: CointelegraphOnly 10 out of 42 managed to outpace altcoin market gains, while half managed to end the period 10% or more behind. One should note that Ether (ETH) managed to rise 25%, EOS rose 23%, and Dash (DASH) gained 21% during that same period. This time around, the low-priced coins strategy did not pan out.After spending the entire month of December drifting sideways, 2020 opened with Bitcoin moving from $7,175 to $8,800 in 15 days, but the digital asset failed to break the $9,000 resistance.Altcoins were already moving strongly alongside the broader market and they pushed even further over the next week.

On the other hand, 14 of them finished this period 10% or more behind.Over the past four periods of altcoins surges against Bitcoin’s price, the three cheapest coins managed to outperform in only one case. On average, 69% of those sub-$3 cryptocurrencies performed worse than the broader altcoin market.On average, 40% of the low-priced coins managed to finish those 15-day periods 10% or more behind altcoin market capitalization gains. Therefore, it’s safe to say that buying the lower-priced cryptocurrencies are not the best option for an investor to choose during an altcoin rally.Although it is possible to find strategies to optimize returns using cheap altcoins during altcoin seasons, this arbitrary indicator alone does not produce higher returns than the broader altcoin market.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

During these discussions on July 13, members indicated crypto gains taxes could rise as high as 20%.Proposed amendments to existing laws also plan to classify cryptocurrencies as “goods,” rather than currencies. Lawmakers have established that virtual assets can be considered as electronic certificates of economic value that can be traded electronically. However, when the transactions are for sales purposes, it could be viewed as an asset.A South Korean court referenced Bitcoin (BTC) in their judgement, stating:“Until now, virtual assets have been recognized only as a function of currency and have not been subject to income tax, but recently, virtual assets (like Bitcoin) are increasingly being traded as goods with property value. Considering various conditions, such as the recognition of intangible assets with property value, the necessity of taxation, and the recognition of the property value of virtual assets are being raised at the same time.”The article also states that crypto trading withholds capital gains tax for those who do not reside in the country.Figures from South Korean financial watchdog, the Financial Services Commission show an average of 1.33 trillion won ($1.10 billion) were being traded per day using crypto. Additionally, an average of 7.609 billion ($6.33 million) won was traded between January - May of 2020.Korean Yonsei University economist, Sung Tae-yoon, warned that the decision to tax crypto capital gains in South Korea may slow the technology’s emerging market."

Some of these include giveaways, sextortion, fake exchanges, fake ICO’s, Bitcoin recovery, video scams, fake tumblers, and malware.In 2017, scammers stole roughly $5M in Bitcoin from unsuspecting victims. In the first quarter of 2020, users had nearly 5x that amount stolen for a total of $24 million.

One such website raked in over $1.5 million in 2020 alone. According to the report, that particular site remains active.Whale Alert commented:“The change in method and the increase in quality and scale suggests that entire professional teams are now behind some of the most successful ones and it is just a matter of time before they start using deepfakes, a technique that will surely revolutionize the scam market.”Cointelegraph recently reported that fraudulent websites had successfully stolen personal records from a number of individuals around the world.The attack was executed as a targeted multistage BTC scam propagated by a number of fraudulent websites, according to a study by the intelligence company, Group-IB."

365,"The crypto market might soon see an uptick in legal hiring as it is moving out of regulatory gray zones, according to a recent article from Bloomberg Law.The publication interviewed a number of experts from the industry following the news that Coinbase had tapped former Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, as the leader of its legal team.The main consensus was that the amount of in-house hires in the crypto industry is likely going to rise significantly in the near future, mainly because the market is actively pushing itself into the financial mainstream.Specifically, Marco Santori, chief legal officer of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, told Bloomberg that the company's legal team is going to double in size in 2021. In his view, crypto companies “are serious about participating in the international discourse around the development of crypto law.”Meanwhile, a definitive regulatory framework is still missing in most countries. In conversation with Bloomberg Law, Ripple’s general counsel, Stuart Alderoty, stressed that the industry needs “smart regulation that both recognizes and fosters the potential of this technology.”According to Santori, the current lack of specific laws makes the crypto industry especially engaging for lawyers who “enjoy an intellectual challenge.”This year has had a number of key examples that indicate crypto could be entering the financial mainstream. JPMorgan Chase reportedly has taken on Coinbase and Gemini as customers. News recently began to circulate of Coinbase potentially being listed on the stock market. Not to mention that there has been an overall increase in crypto from institutional investors.Global payments giant PayPal also recently began hiring crypto talent. At this point, it is looking for engineers, not lawyers."
366,"Following last week’s record-high Bitcoin hash rate, the latest difficulty adjustment saw a change of +9.89%, bringing the level to a new all-time high of over 17.3 trillion on July 13.Despite a lack of recent significant Bitcoin (BTC) price action, the fundamentals securing the network are as healthy as they’ve ever been. This is more positive news for investors concerned about a previous drop in hash rate and difficulty after May’s third reward halving event.Some analysts predicted that the reward halving earlier this year would lead to mass capitulation from unprofitable miners.There was a significant drop in hash rate immediately after the halving, followed by two reductions in the mining difficulty. But an upwards difficulty adjustment of 14.95% last month almost reversed the previous two falls on its own.With both hash rate and difficulty now at historic highs, any concerns around the impact of the halving now seem to have been proven unfounded.The mining difficulty gets automatically adjusted every 2016 blocks (or approximately 14 days), in order to ensure that new blocks are produced every 10 minutes on average.It generally fluctuates with the hash rate (increasing hash power means quicker blocks so difficulty must also be increased), although the overarching trend tends to be upwards.Higher difficulty can also have an impact on mining profitability, which causes some miners to sell up. When this happens, it can potentially force the hash rate back down again."
367,"As Bitcoin's (BTC) price continues to trade in a tightening range, the altcoin market has been pushing higher each week, and the most recent surge has come from Chainlink (LINK).After breaking above the $5 level, LINK's price surged nearly 100% in a matter of days and ended by making a new all-time high at $8.40. Through this massive push, LINK surpassed EOS and Crypto.com (CRO) to claim a spot among the top ten cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap.Investors are now curious to see if Tezos (XTZ) will continue to follow LINK, and there are expectations that other altcoins will also follow LINK’s upward trajectory.Crypto market daily performance.

However, LINK overshot that target by a mile.As the chart shows, the rally might be temporarily over, as sellers are stepping in, but this will only be confirmed if the daily candle closes as shown on the chart above. Currently, the candle shows a giant wick on the upside, indicating that there’s more sell than buy pressure.Aside from the candle, such a giant move is due for a corrective move, so it is good to review the levels to watch for potential support.LINK/USDT one-day chart.

The previous resistance at $6.57 can be confirmed as support, which would suit a renewed test of the $8.50 resistance level.However, a clearer signal would be a corrective move toward the $5 level, as that used to be a significant resistance zone before the massive breakout occurred.LINK/USDT four-hour chart.

A potential wick toward the $6.20 level is an area to watch for.If this zone holds, a renewed test of the highs at $8.50 is likely to occur. If the $6.50 level is lost, further downward pressure is likely to occur on the markets with a potential retest of the $5 level.LINK/BTC one-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe LINK/BTC pair shows a massive breakout as well. The resistance zone at 0.00055000 sats was tested several times before the breakout occurred.This price action is actually quite similar to the resistance zone of Bitcoin that is encountering at $10,000 to $10,500. As the saying goes, the more often a resistance gets tested, the weaker it becomes.In the case of Bitcoin, the resistance zone at $10,000 to $10,500 has been a tough area to surmount for a year already, and for LINK, the 0.00055000 sats barrier has been a resistance zone for seven months.As the breakthrough of the resistance zone occurred, massive acceleration took place, but the chart is showing signs of overextension on the upside. For this reason, a corrective motion is likely to occur.In that case, the potential levels of interest should be the previous resistance at 0.00055000 sats and the area between 0.00065000–0.00066500 sats.XTZ/USDT one-day chart.

However, in the previous months, Tezos has been lagging heavily, but the price finally made a strong move over the weekend.XTZ/USDT has been showing strength in the previous days and currently faces the final hurdle before a new all-time high.The pair secured support at the $2.40 level before continuation and acceleration toward $3 occurred. The next step to watch for is a test of the $2.70–$2.77 level for support.If that level sustains support, it’s likely that XTZ/USDT will break through the $3 barrier and test the all-time high.The $3 resistance area has been tested three times now, and it’s possible that another test of the resistance zone will see the price finally push through it.If XTZ/USDT breaks above $3, it’s assumed we’ll start accelerating and get a similar move to Chainlink. And that similar move means a new all-time high.XTZ/BTC one-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe XTZ/BTC pair is also showing strength, as it recently broke above the 100-day MA. This is also the case with the XTZ/USDT pair.

368,"Could Bitcoin be a credit card killer? Yes, according to one international furniture brand that has started accepting crypto as a payment method.Beliani is a European web-only retailer and manufacturer of modern affordable furniture and home accessories. It began allowing people to make purchases using Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ether (ETH) and USD Coin (USDC) in the fourth quarter of 2019, the combined total of which represents 1%–2% of overall sales.For the company, digital assets represent a significant untapped opportunity, given how the crypto space has an “enormous” $250-billion market cap. Beliani’s main challenge has been raising customer awareness and ensuring shoppers know that they have the option to pay using BTC if they wish — and to sweeten the deal, it has started giving discounts to those who make a purchase using a digital currency.Many merchants have been somewhat reluctant to offer BTC payments at the checkout because they’re worried about volatility. But Beliani, which uses the BitPay platform, says this hasn’t been a concern. The company is shielded from market movements because it never physically takes possession of the crypto it earns; instead, the brand is given the freedom to receive earnings in a currency of its choice.BitPay notes that it delivers some compelling advantages for merchants. Credit card payments can be an expensive business, with processing companies often charging punishing fees that eat into profit margins. By contrast, accepting crypto is much cheaper — and chargebacks are a lot less likely to occur.The company’s figures also suggest that consumers who pay using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are new to the merchant and likelier to spend more — sometimes up to two and a half times more. As a result, retailers who make the leap to digital assets have an opportunity to entice big-spending shoppers.Shoppers benefit, too. Crypto is a payment option that can be used anywhere around the world — reducing the costs of making cross-border payments. There are also safety advantages, as consumers need to provide far less sensitive information in order for a transaction to be completed. Bitcoin eliminates the need for card numbers — details that have all too often been compromised in devastating hacks affecting top retailers.Beliani believes that crypto is moving in the right direction to become a mainstream source of payments within the next five to 10 years. Indeed, we’ve seen a constant flow of major announcements that could help millions of consumers gain exposure to cryptocurrencies for the very first time. Facebook has been putting the finishing touches to its Libra stablecoin, while Reddit has been planning to roll out crypto rewards to its legion of internet-savvy users.A Beliani spokesperson said: “Accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies opens us up to a whole new world of potential buyers. Bitcoin is a great alternative to credit cards, as it’s cheaper, has no chargebacks, and enables us to attract sales from a new customer segment.”And a BitPay spokesperson added: “The Bitcoin market is enormous, valued at $200 billion, offering e-tailers like Beliani a massive opportunity to expand their geographical reach and customer acquisition. The ability to accept crypto payments enables merchants like Beliani to grow sales by attracting new customers and boosting average order values.”The furniture retailer’s success indicates that there’s a lot of momentum in crypto payments — proving that the likes of Bitcoin have use cases that extend beyond speculation. Winning prospective customers is the final step that the industry needs to take, and ensuring that the purchasing process is as painless as possible will be key.Disclaimer.

369,"According to digital asset investment firm executive Charles Edwards, a “Hash Ribbon” buy signal has just gone off. The daily candle close of Bitcoin's (BTC) price on July 13 above $9,250 confirmed it, he said.The last time the Hash Ribbon indicator emerged was on April 25, when the price of Bitcoin hit $7,500. Since then, BTC rallied to as high as $10,440, recording a 39% rally at its peak in June.Edwards said:“Bitcoin Hash Ribbons ‘Buy’ signal just confirmed. The post-Halving signal is particularly special. It will probably be a very long time until the next occurs. ...and so the great bull run begins.”Previously, Edwards explained that the Hash Ribbon signal occurs about once a year. The macro indicator factors in the hash rate and mining difficulty of the Bitcoin blockchain network.The Hash Ribbon indicator with the three-day chart of Bitcoin. Source: Cole Garner, TradingView.comThe basic theory of the Hash Ribbon indicator is that the Bitcoin market tends to reach a bottom when miners capitulate.Miners often capitulate — or sell BTC — when Bitcoin becomes too expensive to mine relative to the cost of mining. That usually occurs when the price of Bitcoin goes through an intense correction where it nears or drops below the breakeven price of mining.In his thesis published in October 2019, Edwards wrote:“Because of the effect of negative sentiment and price action during deep bear markets and times of miner capitulation, the best time to buy Bitcoin is typically somewhere in the middle of the ‘miner capitulation’ period.”Performance of Bitcoin following miner capitulation. Source: Charles EdwardsThe indicator evaluates market sentiment and potential miner capitulation by using the one-month and two-month simple moving average of Bitcoin’s hash rate.The Hash Ribbon likely occurred two times in 2020 due to the halving. Historically, the indicator did not light up more than a single time per year on average.Before the May 11 halving, the indicator signaled that miners were selling. At the time, the breakeven cost of mining after the halving was still unclear, and the price trend of BTC price was uncertain. Going into the halving, the market sentiment was mixed as BTC/USD came off of an unprecedented correction to $3,600 in March.But the rainy season in Sichuan led electricity costs in a region that’s home to major mining centers to substantially drop. Consequently, the cost of mining Bitcoin dropped to as low as $5,000 in some regions in Asia.The Hash Ribbon indicator possibly reemerged as Bitcoin went through a record high difficulty adjustment.The sentiment around the Bitcoin market remains divided. Some traders say that a short-term pullback is imminent. But others believe that, like in early 2018, an extended uptrend is brewing as investors are accumulating.“We are in the BTC accumulation phase,” said Ki Young Ju, CEO at blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. “The 30- and 90-day moving average gap of all exchanges' reserve represents the downside risk. It hit a record low in May this year and is still below zero.”Miner BTC outflows Source: CryptoQuantNevertheless, analysts are optimistic about the Hash Ribbon indicator and its implications due to its historical accuracy.Cryptocurrency trader and hedge fund manager Cantering Clark said:“The fundamental stuff with regards to crypto is not in my wheelhouse. Going off my system still gets me behind the moves eventually. Can someone tell me though, why will this time be different for the Bitcoin Hash Ribbon Buy signal?”The sample size of the indicator has been criticized in the past. Because the indicator tends to emerge once a year, there is a possibility that it merely follows the long-term price trend of BTC. An argument can be made that the indicator merely treads the upward movement of BTC over time."
370,"Bitcoin (BTC) begins Monday by avoiding another test of $9,000, but what could happen to change the mood or even set off a bull run?Cointelegraph takes a look at five major facts that could influence the BTC price during the coming week. The macro outlook seemed more or less stable on Monday. Prior to trading, futures for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and more were modestly up, despite concerns mounting over coronavirus.Specifically, one source quoted by Bloomberg warned on Sunday, the sentiment is one of worry — both about the spread of cases and the United States’ response to protect the economy. If the Federal Reserve intervenes in equities yet again and adds to its balance sheet, it would increase the sense of an artificial presence on the markets in terms of competition.“There is an emerging possibility that the Fed hasn’t gone far enough,” quantitative strategists at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote in a note.“If that came to pass, then maybe valuation of the market simply doesn’t matter.”Fed balance sheet as of July 7. Source: Federal ReserveAs Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin has shown no signs of lessening its dependence on stocks in recent weeks. Moves up or down appeared to shape BTC/USD performance, with last week’s trip from $9,000 to near $9,500 and back down again being no exception.Analysts particularly eye the S&P 500, an index with which Bitcoin currently shows a 95% correlation. Coronavirus is also weighing on U.S. consumer confidence, fresh data meanwhile shows, with five indicators all flashing bearish in July after recovering during the two previous months.On the topic of macro, trader sentiment in cryptocurrency still contrasts with that of traditional markets.That was the conclusion from two incarnations of the Fear & Greed Index, a basket of factors designed to show whether traders are overly risk-off or unduly confident.The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in the “fear” category with little movement for several weeks. By contrast, the traditional market equivalent is flashing “greed,” while slowly trending downwards towards “neutral.”On a scale of 1 to 100, Monday scored 59, down 7 points from the same time one month ago. The cryptocurrency equivalent measured 43 for Monday and 38 last month.Fuelling traditional “greed” was “extreme greed” in stock price breadth, while derivatives put and call options, along with safe-haven demand, also sat firmly in the “greed” range.Crypto Fear & Greed Index 1-month chart. Source: Alternative.meThe greed narrative fits with other signs that stocks, in particular, are overly buoyant. As noted by market commentator Holger Zschaepitz on Monday, the correlation between the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is on the up, in what he describes as a “sign of exuberance.”At the same time, banks are gearing up for a dismal quarterly performance, something that is on track to be the worst since the 2008 financial crisis.As Cointelegraph noted, misgivings about stocks’ recovery since March have long persisted in Bitcoin circles. The Fed’s interventions, in particular, have fuelled accusations that the entire atmosphere is now artificial, and “true” value is of limited relevance.Numbers this week show that investors themselves have in fact gone for cash and gold — not equities — in 2020. Inflows into the two assets beat others since the start of the year, similar to 2008-9.Inflows as a % of assets under management chart. Source: Jeroen Blokland/ TwitterMonday sees a new Bitcoin difficulty adjustment, the latest in a series of bullish moves that underline miner confidence.With the event just hours away at press time, estimates suggest a difficulty uptick of around 9.5%. This is much stronger than the previous move two weeks ago, which was stagnant, and on the way to matching last month’s 15% surge, which was the largest since early 2018. Difficulty represents how much effort is required to solve equations when mining new Bitcoin blocks. Upward adjustments suggest more competition, with Monday’s estimate slowly increasing over the past week.At the same time, the network hash rate, having reached an all-time average high last week, has tailed off slightly. Data from Blockchain estimates a seven-day average of 124.42 EH/s for Monday, having previously hit 126 EH/s.Hash rate is a sensitive and inexact metric, but nonetheless provides an idea of how much computing power is being dedicated to Bitcoin mining. Major swings are not uncommon, and a popular theory suggests that bullish progress for hash rate is followed some time later by a copycat Bitcoin price move.Bitcoin 7-day average hash rate 1-month chart. Source: BlockchainBitcoin futures markets generated few opportunities for price movements over the weekend. Low volatility means that markets will begin Monday in a similar position to that at which they ended on Friday.If Monday and Friday do not match, a “gap” opens up in futures markets which the BTC/USD spot tends to fill in subsequent days or even hours.CME Bitcoin futures chart showing lack of weekend gap. Source: TradingViewNonetheless, futures remain a source of suspicion for some. As Cointelegraph reported, in-house analyst filbfilb warned last week that weak performance could be a sign of worse to come. Specifically, one indicator showed uncanny similarities to the days before Bitcoin’s March crash. Should history repeat itself, he added, the drop, however, should not be as intense as at that time."
371,"Investors in Japan increased their crypto holdings during the early stages of the pandemic before the government issued economic relief payments. According to a July 13 report from Japanese news outlet Nikkei, the Bank of Japan revealed that the supply of M3 in the country — a measure of various money stock in circulation — increased 5.9% in June to $13.5 trillion. The amount of liquid assets available to residents of Japan has increased following the government issuing 100,000 yen — roughly $936 — stimulus payments to individuals, 300,000 yen to some households, and other payments to companies in response to the coronavirus outbreak.The Nikkei reported that such payments have made the cash flow in Japan “abundant” with fewer increasing their spending habits. If this money were to go towards any number of asset markets, it could form a bubble as quantitative easing continues while inflation is limited.Cointelegraph reported in April that the number of purchases for $1,200 on crypto exchange Coinbase increased fourfold in March. The data suggests that Americans may have been using the government-issued checks intended for economic relief to invest in cryptocurrency in the midst of major nationwide shutdowns.In March, investors in Japan increased their holdings of major cryptocurrencies, by 11% for Bitcoin (BTC), 5.7% for Ethereum (ETH), and 6.4% for Ripple (XRP), as well as moderate gains for other altcoins. The issuance of $936 stimulus checks in Japan began in April. This means Japanese residents were investing more heavily in crypto following “Black Thursday” and during early measures in the country to prevent the spread of the coronavirus — many schools in Japan closed in March."

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.Bitcoin’s price has hardly moved an inch in the last six weeks — barely moving 2% in either direction from its average. This long period of stagnation resembles what happened in early 2017. BTC stayed around $900 for the first three months of the year, which was followed by an explosive 300% move in the second quarter. Of course, Bitcoin is facing stubborn levels of resistance before it clears $10,500 — and this week, BTC’s correlation to the S&P 500 reached an all-time high. On Thursday, a bad day for stocks saw Bitcoin abruptly drop below $9,200. Key metrics do show that institutional interest in crypto is high and rising, but even some of the world’s biggest Bitcoin bulls are sounding a note of caution. Mike Novogratz, who wrongly predicted BTC would hit $20,000 by the end of 2019, has said he doesn’t recommend investors putting the majority of their funds in crypto. “My sense is that Bitcoin way outperforms gold, but I would tell people to have a lot less Bitcoin than they have gold, just because of the volatility,” he told CNBC on Tuesday.Weird, weird, weird news this week: Dogecoin is back from the dead. The novelty crypto asset leaped 50% in 24 hours this week thanks to a viral TikTok challenge encouraging its young user base to pump the coin. The most popular video under the hashtag #DogecoinTiktokChallenge has amassed more than 500,000 views — and in it, the user appears to describe a classic pump scheme, saying: “Let’s all get rich! Dogecoin is practically worthless. There are 800 million TikTok users. Invest just $25. Once the stock hits $1, you’ll have 10 grand [$10,000]. Tell everyone you know.” The frenzied action prompted the owner of the @Dogecoin Twitter account to warn its followers. On Wednesday, the account tweeted: “Be mindful of the intentions people have when they direct you to buy things. None of them are in the spot to be financially advising. Make choices right for you, do not ride other people’s FOMO or manipulation. Stay safe. Be smart.” Bitfinex listed DOGE in response to the demand — with “how to buy Dogecoin” overtaking “how to buy Bitcoin” on Google Trends. DOGE’s price has cooled substantially since hitting highs of $0.0054 on Wednesday — falling 32% to $0.0036. Looks like it’s a long way off before hitting $1.Coinbase is reportedly preparing to list on the U.S. stock market as early as this year. If successful, it would be the first crypto exchange to make its debut on traditional markets. But hurdles do lie ahead, and Coinbase would need the green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission first. According to Reuters, the plans are rather fluid at the moment and subject to change — but the company has been in talks to hire investment banks and law firms. Should the SEC give Coinbase the go-ahead, it would likely represent a landmark victory for crypto advocates vying for mainstream endorsement. Coinbase was valued at more than $8 billion during its last private fundraising round in 2018. It’s thought the exchange isn’t pursuing a traditional initial public offering where new shares are sold; instead, it’s exploring a direct listing where existing investors aren’t bound by lock-up restrictions.This news will be music to Facebook’s ears… not. Monetary historian Barry Eichengreen has declared that “Libra is an interesting idea that will never see the light of day.” Speaking at the virtual Unitize conference, the UC Berkeley professor warned that the stablecoin sector is largely ignorant of monetary economics — and claimed Libra faces too many “insoluble” problems and too much resistance from governments. Eichengreen said his work had led to invitations “to a series of lunches at excellent San Francisco restaurants with the founders and funders of prospective stablecoins.” But he added: “My conclusion was that my luncheon companions knew all about blockchain, but they didn’t know much about monetary economics.” According to Eichengreen, many executives were unaware of past speculative attacks on pegged exchange rates and are struggling to grapple with the “big uncertainties” that need to be resolved in order for projects to get off the ground.A blockchain browser that was forked from the open-source Brave browser has rebranded itself after receiving legal threats.

Tell everyone you know.”jamezg97, Dogecoin userCoinbase analyst Max Bronstein has predicted that “fireworks” are coming to the global currency market — and a spike in volatility might largely benefit the price of BTC. He said: “A lot has been said on BTC’s performance during bouts of equity volatility, but not as much on how BTC would perform during bouts of FX/currency volatility. With global currency vols off historic lows and a huge wave of new debt, fireworks are coming to the currency market.” Bronstein said the global monetary system was fragile even before the pandemic hit the international economy, with many countries at risk of seeing their currencies decline in value. He believes Bitcoin could benefit as fears of hyperinflation and devaluation hit, adding: “In a regime where nearly every government has an incentive to debase their currency, few monetary systems stand to benefit as much as Bitcoin does. Never before has an open-source competitor to fiat currency been so needed.”An unusual row has been brewing this week that has the potential to be bad news for crypto companies. Although the “.io” domain was formally the country code top-level domain designation for “Indian Ocean,” the extension was acquired on the open market by a U.K.-based firm in the 1990s. The U.K. government receives an undisclosed share of revenue from sales of .io domain names, in what a legal complaint claims is part of the ongoing colonial exploration of the economic property and livelihood of those in the region. The complaint notes that “thousands of crypto asset platforms” that “generate vast sums of unregulated and untaxed revenue” use .io — and accuses the U.K. of tolerating “massive criminality” in overlooking the existence of “criminal entities.”New York’s Supreme Court has ruled that the Bitfinex crypto exchange and sister stablecoin company Tether must face claims they concealed the loss of corporate and client funds. The state’s Attorney General Letitia James alleges that the loss of $850 million was hidden. Bitfinex asserts that its funds were deposited with Crypto Capital — a Panamanian firm accused of providing shadow banking services to virtual currency exchanges — before being seized by government authorities in various countries. They are working to recover the money. The court rejected the firms’ claim that the court does not have jurisdiction over Bitfinex — noting several of its staff work in New York, and USDT had been used by local residents. In other news this week, it emerged that Tether has blacklisted 39 Ethereum addresses worth $46 million in USDT. General counsel Stuart Hoegner said: “Tether routinely assists law enforcement in their investigations... Through the freeze address feature, Tether has been able to help users and exchanges to save and recover tens of millions of dollars stolen from them by hackers.”Support for Telegram Open Network’s testnet is going to be discontinued by the start of August. Participants are being encouraged to save all of their relevant testing data and stop their testing processes. Even though the testnet is going to be turned off in less than a month, users will still be able to continue their experimentation by installing their own validators. Telegram launched the TON testnet on Sept. 6, 2019, ahead of an anticipated launch on Oct. 31 last year — but the plans were never realized because the SEC suddenly deemed the company’s $1.7-billion ICO illegal in mid-October. After a long-running legal battle, Telegram agreed to shut down its TON project, as well as return $1.2 billion to investors in line with a court-approved final settlement.The close interaction between traditional finance and regulators is the key element in the development of the cryptocurrency industry, Alex Axelrod argues.CBDCs are one of the hottest topics in the fintech space, but as their inception comes closer, serious privacy concerns come with it.

373,"COVID-19 has become a defining moment in the course of our society, but the impact of the pandemic can be seen through its effects on the economy and society in general. From the perspective of a Bitcoin (BTC) investor, there are many things to consider.Coronavirus emergent patterns determine how the infection spreads and sets the society on a particular course into the future. The impact of the novel coronavirus on consumer society has been tremendous. The effect has mostly been seen as the closure of workplaces, resulting in people either working from home, getting laid off or in some cases, being furloughed.Unemployment figures have set records in western countries, especially in the United States. The road to economic recovery is still unknown. The current situation seems to indicate that businesses need new types of fundraising in order to fully recover or to restructure.The lag between infection cases and deaths is around two to three weeks: This means that whenever the epidemic resurfaces, according to data obtained from the first wave, this happens predictably, in risk groups and regionally.Exposure to blockchain-based assets is concentrated among young male professionals aged around 30. If we observe new entrants in the blockchain asset classes among consumer segments, we may observe that the greatest numbers of new users have been coming geographically from countries where the local currency is experiencing high inflation, concentrating roughly in Africa and Latin America. Socio-economically, they are middle-class professionals. While most are Bitcoin maximalists, there has been an increasing interest in the altcoin markets.Recently, a buying spree fuelled by videos shared on the social media app TikTok caused a significant price spike in the value of Dogecoin (DOGE). The buyers were almost exclusively teenagers and young adults who are current cryptocurrency holders. While Dogecoin has been known as an asset whose value is based entirely on its virality, the recent phenomenon suggests that there are plenty of new entrants in the broader cryptocurrency market. It should be noted that this Dogecoin pump took only hours to top out, compared to the several weeks the eight other times the coin had gained significant value. This signals an impulsive move.Retail investors in the risk groups typically do not invest in Bitcoin or blockchain-based assets. Wealth owned by those in their 70s and above is typically in real estate, bonds and indices. The same investors, who are the most susceptible to contracting and dying of the novel coronavirus, are the most established in our society. Meanwhile, statistics show that the deaths are heavily concentrated among working-class individuals, ethnic minorities and those lacking access to quality health care. Residents of care homes have been particularly vulnerable.This is significant because the statistics indicate that the majority of victims of the novel coronavirus are unlikely to hold significant wealth in either traditional or blockchain-based assets. Therefore, the impact of the coronavirus on cryptocurrency and blockchain-based asset markets may be quite negligible, while in traditional markets, the outbreak is likely to unlock assets typically held by the victims. Among elderly members of the working class, the majority of wealth is held in residential real estate and pension funds.This shows that the coronavirus’s impact may make cheap real estate even cheaper, particularly in the countryside, despite people temporarily looking for relocation there.The effect on Bitcoin in this respect would be practically nil.Its influence on institutional money has been two-fold. On one hand, institutions have enjoyed unprecedented support from the government through bailing out their debt by buying equity-backed bonds, and on the other hand, funds such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust have seen increased volumes.Institutions are traditionally seen as swing traders; they bet on long-term market moves. Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based assets as an asset class has been steadily growing with the number of investment instruments increasing over the past five years. Typically, institutions hedge into cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based assets with a narrow focus on a handful of tokens and sophisticated trading techniques, such as leveraged trading and options.On the technical front, institutions have implemented blockchain technology to support their existing services.This means that institutions see blockchain as a tool to facilitate lag and cryptocurrencies as a way to hedge their portfolios outside of traditional markets. Arguably, this renders the influence of institutions in regard to blockchain-based assets a stabilizing factor rather than a market mover.Bitcoin fundamentals have shown signs of transitioning into the next growth cycle in the next few years. The halving has limited the supply and placed the asset on par with leading fiat currencies regarding inflation, at around 2% per annum.The stock-to-flow ratio is an indicator that shows overall historical trends in Bitcoin. Currently, the indicator suggests an impending rise in value over the long term. Bitcoin has risen in value at some point after halvings due to increased pressure caused by decreased supply.Lengthening cycles is an assumption based on the hard-coded feature of halving in Bitcoin’s supply. Each cycle, the halving takes longer to occur, therefore driving a longer cycle of emergence in asset value. Data supports this assumption, as each cycle thus far has taken longer to realize its potential.Startup companies in the crypto industry have increased exponentially in both numbers as well as total seed capital raised over time across market cycles. The ICO bubble of 2017 has shown itself to be an impulsive move rather than a one-time event. According to ICORating, there is still a substantial number of projects raising funds through initial coin offerings. The problem cited during the 2017 market bubble around due diligence has lead to the takeover of ICOs by trusted third-parties. Increased government regulation has strengthened the fundamentals of average ICO, driving interest especially among scale-ups and startups whose product ideas benefit from a blockchain-based asset either as a regulated security or as a consumer utility. Consequently, another larger ICO bubble might start to grow in the upcoming market cycle.Organic consumer demand bottomed during the first wave of COVID-19 in western countries, which resulted in a significant drop in Bitcoin’s price. This dip was caused by initial panic-selling reaching the 200-week moving average and dipping below it, followed by a quick, V-shaped recovery. Data suggests that while institutions sold, retail bought the dip.According to the modern portfolio theory, quick V-shaped recoveries indicate strong fundamentals on the asset. It is safe to suggest that the coronavirus at least acted as an event confirming the overall uptrend.The upcoming bull market will likely be driven by consumer demand. While retail investors are restructuring their personal portfolios in the world outside of cryptocurrencies, they are likely to become more interested in the asset class over time. The motivation in getting into the market is dominated by hedging against inflation and being exposed to assets that may be used across national borders.Alex Althausen, the CEO StormGain — a crypto trading and exchange platform — said:“Nowadays, we see the correlation of Bitcoin price with S&P 500 of 66%, but we have to consider that it is the bull market. If, or when, the price of traditional assets like stocks drops down because of a second wave of COVID-19, investors will be more actively using protective assets like gold and Bitcoin.”Bitcoin is seen as a safe haven asset particularly because it is easier for consumers to access than traditional financial instruments. There are no minimum investment amounts, no rules on accredited investors, and the increased availability of exchange services makes the asset class attractive to the average consumer.Smart money is invested early on in promising projects, whereas dumb money usually hitches a ride on an established trend near the top. The distinction, therefore, can be made through the amount of work required to do market research, as well as exposure to the creators. Smart money represents the early adopters. Recently, we’ve seen an explosion in decentralized finance, nonfungible tokens, and more traditional security and utility tokens. Main street brands, such as European football clubs have entered the market through their own tokens and platforms.The broader cryptocurrency market is set for a Cambrian explosion of assets and a market comparable to the creation of the internet itself. As COVID-19 acts as a catalyst in the dismantling of old institutions and legacy financial systems, it will pave way for cryptocurrency and tokens to take their place.Bitcoin has laid the foundation for the future of finance. As Binance CEO Changpeng Zhou stated:“The pandemic has changed the world as we know it; it will never be the same again. And in this new world, we believe crypto will play an ever increasing role.”The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Tuomas Santakallio is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, blockchain developer and a serial startup entrepreneur with a background in international development and grassroots innovation.

375,"The five-day Unitize virtual blockchain conference organized by BlockShow and San Francisco Blockchain Week ended with the final session on Friday. The event saw appearances from Heath Tarbert, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum; and Tim Draper, a serial blockchain investor, as well as other speakers from a diverse pool of market segments both within and outside the crypto space.Blockchain adoption, decentralized finance, central bank digital currencies and the future of Bitcoin (BTC) dominated the conversation in many of the panels. The event also saw speakers chart possible paths forward for the advancement of the industry.If you didn’t have the opportunity to catch all the goings-on at the conference, it is available on Cointelegraph’s YouTube channel in full. Or, to keep it short and sweet, below are the top 10 quotes from the event sponsored by crypto derivatives exchange platform Bybit.Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin revealed that stateless clients implementation on the Ethereum network is still unattainable due to fundamental limitations, stating that any help from the community is welcome:“There are a bunch of fancy arithmetic techniques that allow us to cut these witness sizes down to the point where the extra data that stateless clients need to download is actually not that much. But still research and still a lot of refinement required, and this is something where we actively welcome more help from the academic research community.”CBDCs were a popular topic on the first two days of the conference. Matthew Graham, the CEO of Sino Global Capital, reasoned that China’s digital currency electronic payment is geared toward yuan internationalization.Echoing Graham’s sentiments, Douglas Arner, the director of the Asian Institute of International Financial Law at the University of Hong Kong, identified the DCEP as having a better chance of interoperability than many other national CBDC plans, adding:“If we think of the Chinese [CBDC] proposal at the moment, it is largely limited to operating within the context of the physical and electronic borders. But one can imagine how in the context of those electronic borders, if one integrates the system with, say, the RMB swap lines that are engaged in a range of different countries, that sort of RMB electronic area can be expanded outside.”University of California, Berkeley professor Barry Eichengreen called Libra “an interesting idea that will never see the light of day,” while arguing against the future potential of stablecoins, declaring:“Stablecoins are either fragile — they are prone to attack and collapse if they are only partially backed or collateralized with actual dollars or dollar bank balances, or they are prohibitively expensive to scale-up if they are, in fact, fully or over-collateralized.”Sheila Warren of the World Economic Forum said that unbanked and underbanked people will flock to blockchain solutions if entrepreneurs can bridge the technological gaps:“We have to look at what is actually the lowest hanging fruit there. Well, oddly enough, it’s people who have been excluded from traditional systems for whatever reason. They’re the hardest to build for in many ways, but they’re the people most willing to accommodate or try something new.”Ali Loveys, the chief privacy officer of ConsenSys Health, advised blockchain entrepreneurs to focus on value creation, opining:“The challenges are always less about the technology than about the business value and the people who are interested in using it or resistant to using it. [...] I don’t come in to sell blockchain, I come in to talk about business issues and where we find a good fit, and we move forward.”Balaji Srinivasan, a general partner at venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, and Meltem Demirors, the chief strategy officer at CoinShares, spoke about Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currency debasement. According to Srinivasan:“Ultimately, there are two modalities that people can accept: A, we have total power; B, no one has power over us. On the other hand of the spectrum you have Bitcoin, which is open-state, open-source, open execution, totally inspectable, totally transparent, based on mathematics and no one has power over it.”Speaking at a fireside chat, Heath Tarbert, the chairman of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, predicted that altcoin futures trading in the country will happen once cryptos get more regulatory clarity, stating:“Unlike my prediction about Ether, at the this point, I don’t see anything on the horizon, but I think it is inevitable that in the future, once major classes of digital assets receive the clarity on whether they are securities or commodities, you’ll start to see them also be listed, particularly as they get more popular and people do see them as a store of value.”Coin Metrics researcher Lucas Nuzzi said crypto exchanges can undo hacks by forcing blockchain reorgs, using rented mining hash power, but there is a catch:“It’d actually be impossible for exchanges, or any entity really, to reorg BTC via NiceHash. This could, however, be an effective counterattack on smaller chains with more niche hashing algos, like Lyra or Equihash.”For Richard Holden, an economics professor at the University of New South Wales Business School, blockchain voting will prevent mail-in voter fraud but will be to the benefit of the Democratic Party, arguing:“Distributed ledger technology might be an interesting defense against the idea of there being fraud with vote by mail. But DLT could in principle be more even immune to those considerations. So, it’s going to play a very important role going forward because it has a potential political skew — not by intent, but just by implication.”While accepting the unlikelihood of his victory in the November election, crypto venture capitalist Brock Pierce said his decision to run for president is aimed at putting blockchain on the political agenda. Pierce bemoaned America’s perceived technological decline, stating:“The United States historically has been the capital of innovation, on the front lines of technologies like blockchain. I feel that this is not a great environment for innovators to build. I’m watching many of the best innovators in our nation moving to Asia, moving to Europe, moving to other places because they don’t feel safe to innovate and experiment.”"
376,"There is no doubt that cryptocurrency — specifically Bitcoin (BTC), which is frequently used as a barometer for the health of the entire sector — has made a comeback. As of the writing of this article, Bitcoin stands at a little over $9,000, very close to the $10,000 rebound that investors hoped for sometime this year — and we are barely in the third quarter.Although there are signs that crypto winter is over, many experts are still understandably cautious.Related: What's Next for the Industry as 'Crypto Winter' Thaws?Cryptocurrency has been a notoriously unstable investment, first selling at less than a penny and then varying from $400 to $1,242 between all of 2013 and 2016. In 2017, crypto investors were gleeful (and some, probably, quite smug) to see the currency reach the insane height of $4,400 and then end the year breaking an astonishing $20,000 — all this after plummeting to $2,000 that same September.Of course, what followed that bright season in the cryptocurrency industry was what we refer to as crypto winter — the drastic drop in value following several high-profile Ponzi schemes, successful hacks, crypto-jacking attempts and overall negative media coverage.In this article, we will discuss the question of whether crypto winter is over, whether those who have already invested have a reason to be hopeful, and whether those who haven’t should jump on the bandwagon soon before prices skyrocket. We will also place a focus on blockchain technology as it exists both inside and outside the cryptocurrency industry, and why widespread adoption of this new technology is an indicator of cryptocurrency’s future success.For many of the experts, the answer seems to be “yes.” From crypto enthusiasts to Forbes, the current viewpoint of many is that Bitcoin is poised to make huge gains for the next 10 years. Although the vagaries of the cryptocurrency industry are as mysterious as Satoshi Nakamoto himself, it seems that we have headed into a period of stability during which the fundamentals of cryptocurrency are better understood and trusted.Only 4% of Americans polled cite cryptocurrency as their preferred long-term investment, but this is very likely going to change in the near future, as Bitcoin has nothing but room to grow.Many compare the future of Bitcoin to that of the internet, and claim that the commodity is going through the same growing pains of scalability, availability and ease of use that the internet first went through from 1995.Similarly, market experts note that although only 11% of Americans own Bitcoin, those numbers are on par with other huge technological developments in their early stages, such as smartphones.Many point out that the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak to traditional banking and investing institutions may be a motivator to invest in the digital currency to protect against inflation and the questionable resilience of fiat currencies.Many experts also suggest that cryptocurrency transactions aren’t completely secure and anonymous without the use of a virtual private network, or VPN. They are also irreversible. Once a coin is gone from your account, it can easily vanish without a trace. Hackers have taken advantage of this by breaking into exchanges and stealing small amounts from each user.So, it will likely take time until Bitcoin gains trust from the wider public, but for those willing to take a risk, it might be the most profitable investment of 2020, specifically for those who are willing to wait 10 years to witness the true extent of its growth.Although much is left to be seen about the future of cryptocurrency, no one can deny that the idea of creating a digital-only currency is as old as science fiction. From transportation to food to medicine to video games, a wide variety of industries continue to look to blockchain technology for logistical and transactional solutions. In seven years, it is estimated that $300 billion worth of food products will be tracked using blockchain technology, saving over $100 billion annually.In 2018, JPMorgan surprised the traditional financial world by publicly stating that blockchain technology is the way of the future for cross-border payments. A year after that, IBM, Citibank and Barclays announced the development of their own blockchain-based platforms, and Dubai made a statement that it has a new goal to become blockchain-powered by 2020.Although this is still a relatively new technology, there is little doubt that blockchain and the cryptographic technology it uses will rapidly dominate the landscape in coming years. Countless top-tier engineers, product developers and designers are building real solutions on top of blockchain, working to perfect this technology for widespread use across various industries.It is possible that we may have to wait until blockchain technology is fully understood, utilized and appreciated by the masses in order to provide cryptocurrency a much-needed publicity boost.After all, although currencies and monetary investments like cryptocurrencies can go through wild ups and downs, there is nothing more stable than an already proven and reliable technological solution like blockchain.Many unanswered questions and problems that still exist are unsettling to cautious investors, but these obstacles bear resemblance to other successful, ground-breaking technologies such the internet and Apple smartphones. Furthermore, much of the negative press about the problems associated with Bitcoin is due to scams that could have been easily avoided with adequate financial knowledge and cybersecurity.Also, let’s not forget that traditional banking institutions have a vested interest in making cryptocurrency seem like a questionable investment. Of course, big banks and traditional investing platforms have significant power to fund research and news stories that influence opinions on a daily basis. This might be more of a reflection of their fear of competition rather than a legitimate portrayal of the value of the cryptocurrency industry.Certainly, if you prefer safe and reliable investments with moderate-to-low gains in the short term, Bitcoin is probably not the right investment for you.However, if you are looking to potentially gain big by investing in a growing new industry, and are not afraid of the “spring cleaning” that is currently needed to make improvements to the future security and useability of cryptocurrency, it might be just the right time to buy Bitcoin.After all, where there is no risk, there is no reward — and it may be wise not to wait until everyone is singing the praises of Bitcoin in the coming years to make the decision to invest.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The complaint alleges that Ponle and his accomplices defrauded American companies of tens of millions of dollars while converting $6.5 million into 1,500 BTC:“Preliminary blockchain analysis indicates that PONLE received at least 1,494.71506296 bitcoin related to these BEC schemes, valued at approximately $6,599,499.98 at the time he received the proceeds.”The complaint said it is clear that Ponle was not terribly concerned with covering his tracks on the Bitcoin network as he has been using the same address (16AtGJbaxL2kmzx4mW5ocpT2ysTWxmacWn) since 2014, though the complaint focuses on his illicit activity throughout 2019 only.Gemini was the criminals' favorite exchange. This may seem surprising, considering that the exchange is considered one of the most compliant in the industry. However, this choice can probably be explained by the fact the accused needed a U.S.-based exchange that caters to businesses.On Feb. 15, 2019, Ponle’s associate confirmed that $2,149,000 had been successfully deposited to Gemini and converted to BTC.A discussion between Ponle and his associate of the Feb. 15, 2019 transactionThese transactions, when traced on the Bitcoin blockchain, amounted to 340 and 261 BTC each, 601 BTC in total. At the time, Bitcoin price was at around $3,500.Two Bitcoin transactions from Gemini exchange to Ponle’s address. Source: Crystal BlockchainAnother transaction took place on Jan. 17, 2019 when Ponle’s accomplice converted $119,000 into 33.13 BTC — in the FBI complaint, it mistakenly says 3.13 instead. This transaction originated from an unidentified address, but it is one hop away from another American exchange — Kraken. Although the latter is not mentioned in the complaint.In July, the FBI was able to infiltrate Ponle’s inner circle when an agent began communicating with Ponle online using the same handle that was previously used by one of his associates. On Sept. 9, 2019, a discussion between Ponle and his associate about converting $5 million to Bitcoin took place.A discussion between Ponle and his associate of the Sept. 9, 2019 transactionUnbeknown to Ponle, this time it was an FBI agent at the other end of the chat. Although the complaint does not specify it, this transaction presumably never happened as no associated transaction can be identified with the “16AtGJ BTC Wallet.”Whereas Gemini was the exchange of choice for converting stolen fiat into Bitcoin, LocalBitcoins and Huobi were preferable choices for cashing out. According to Crystal Blockchain, 577 BTC was cleared via the former and 539 BTC via the latter. Both have been criticized for lax KYC procedures in the past.Ponle and his colleague Abbas lived a life of ostentatious wealth, parading their newly acquired fortunes on Instagram. In one of his last posts, Ponle admonished his followers against the guilt associated with wealth:“YOU ARE WORTH THE PLEASURES OF YOUR LABOR 💙 Stop letting people make you feel guilty for the wealth you’ve acquired, especially when you paid in blood, sweat and tears, to have the things that are deemed “ un-purchase-able”.”Ponle’s Instagram post.

378,"Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than 10 years, but the legal status of Bitcoin (BTC) and most other cryptocurrencies remains unclear and has different definitions in various jurisdictions. Are they money, an asset, a product, property or something else? Should they trade freely or must be tightly regulated? In the absence of a clear answer, governments in the United States and Europe are still issuing legal acts to regulate the cryptocurrency market and trying to determine their attitude toward cryptos.In the first several months of 2020 alone in France, Germany and Australia, authorities issued decisions with three different interpretations of the nature of Bitcoin: as a currency, a financial instrument that is applied as a means of exchange among individuals or legal entities, and as a security.Meanwhile, the taxation system, the complexity of regulation and reporting depend on the classification of cryptocurrencies. For example, currency functions in conditions of relatively weak regulatory oversight. Securities, by contrast, are usually subject to more onerous rules regarding price transparency and trade reporting.Only one thing is for sure: Cryptocurrencies are difficult to attribute to any existing class of assets because they are unique. Given that cryptocurrencies are very different from one another, they also fit into several classes. But that issue aside, here’s what the legal regimes for cryptocurrencies in various countries make of crypto in 2020.The U.S. is a hub of cryptocurrency regulation in the world and sets the pace, for better or worse, for a lot of adoption. To begin with, laws governing the crypto industry vary from state to state, and federal authorities also interpret and regulate them differently. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which analyzes transactions to flag financial crimes, does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender. However, since 2013, it has been considering cryptocurrency exchanges financial as services operators and tokens as “other property” that replaces currency.Exchanges must obey the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. The Internal Revenue Service, the nation’s tax authority, on the other hand, views cryptocurrencies as property and has issued a tax guide.Several federal regulators have also been fighting to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges. The Securities and Exchange Commission considers cryptocurrencies as securities, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission considers Bitcoin to be a commodity and oversees the cryptocurrency derivatives market.2020 began with news about the introduction of new restrictions, as the U.S. Treasury Secretary said that the office intended to introduce stricter rules regarding digital currencies to prevent suspicious transactions using cryptocurrencies. But a month later, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which fights cross-border crimes in the U.S., developed a new method to track unlicensed cryptographic activity and proposed a Cryptocurrency Intelligence Program for 2021. The cryptocurrency intelligence program offers new rules and requirements for tax reporting in order to pave the way for the widespread adoption of blockchain technology in the country.However, in March of this year, the U.S. saw a major economic slowdown due to COVID-19 containment efforts and many voicing the opinion that cryptocurrencies could help the population in difficult times. The U.S. government allowed Square, run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, to take part in the federal program to help the economy through the crypto application CashApp. The company in the U.S. was able to get low-interest loans.Cryptocurrencies are not prohibited in the U.S., but they are still not integrated into the country’s financial structure, with the SEC striking down attempts to register a product that can be accessed by regular investors. Just a few of such examples range from stalling the launch of Facebook’s brainchild Libra to rejecting numerous Bitcoin-ETF applications or the abrupt proceedings between the SEC and Telegram over the latter’s Gram tokens.At the end of March 2020, there was a bill submitted to the U.S. Congress that mentioned a digital dollar in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it soon disappeared from the document and that was that. Glen Goodman, the author of The Crypto Trader shared his view with Cointelegraph on the U.S. government’s attitude toward a national cryptocurrency. According to him, the U.S. has everything to lose when it comes to crypto:“So the U.S. establishment is very nervous about encouraging any cryptocurrencies that could threaten the dollar’s dominant position in global finance. The U.S. enjoys what’s long been called the ‘exorbitant privilege’ of being able to print seemingly endless dollars and borrow unprecedented amounts without causing a collapse in the dollar. This is all because nearly every other country uses dollars as the standard for international trade and finance. As long as everyone needs dollars, the U.S. prints and borrows freely without crashing their currency.”In Russia, where the population is rather crypto-friendly, the government still has not decided what Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are but appears to be mostly hostile toward the technology. It has not issued a ban, however, at least not yet. So far, it is possible to understand what Russia makes of crypto through its court decisions.Since 2018, there have been two cases where crypto was recognized as “other property.” In May 2018, the court came to such a verdict and ordered the debtor to transfer access to their crypto wallet. The second case occurred in February 2020 where the court also issued a similar decision, recognizing Bitcoin as other property.However, the most interesting thing in Russia’s relationship with cryptocurrencies is the long-delayed adoption of the corresponding law, which should help develop a new type of financial asset in the country, but has been stuck in limbo since 2018. This year, the Russian government has already drafted this act several times only to postpone its implementation each time.At the beginning of this year, it became known that the Russian government decided to update the law on bribery and the fight against money laundering in relation to cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the law will classify any cryptocurrency transaction as a potential money-laundering risk. Later, the country’s Central Bank sought to ban the use of cryptocurrencies as a payment method.But all-in-all, it seems that financial regulators in Russia can’t find a compromise between allowing or prohibiting cryptocurrencies. The latest version of the law called On Digital Financial Assets appeared in early July and defined Bitcoin as property but not as legal tender. Many experts doubt this act will ever be adopted.Cryptocurrencies are legal throughout the European Union, but specific regulation and standards vary among countries. In matters of taxes, most EU countries are guided by the decision of the European Court of Justice of 2015, according to which the exchange of cryptocurrencies should be exempted from value-added tax.Additionally, all European countries have adjusted their regulatory standards to the recommendations issued by the Financial Action Task Force in June 2019. According to the FATC, any crypto site should begin to comply with strict Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering standards, as well as sharing data with the regulator.In January 2020, the 5th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive came into effect, requiring the registration of cryptocurrency exchanges with financial regulators and the transfer of client wallet addresses to them. In general, the EU has been gradually tightening its regulation of the cryptocurrency market.The global economic instability caused by the novel coronavirus has affected the development of the crypto industry in Europe, accelerating the adoption of cryptocurrencies in some countries.France is one of the few remaining EU countries where there is still no clear definition of cryptocurrencies. In March of this year, a lower court called the Commercial Court of Nanterre recognized BTC as currency, making it a fungible interchangeable asset. Although there is no case law in the country, this court ruling may have set an effective precedent.In Portugal, the government decided to follow its neighbors and pushed the spread of cryptocurrencies with technological free zones. At the end of April, the country approved a nationwide plan to promote digitization in several areas. The Portuguese government will provide infrastructure and incentives for innovation, entrepreneurship and competition, as well as for the internationalization of enterprises in the country.The tiny territory of Gibraltar seems to be positioning itself as the real cryptocurrency hotspot this year, attracting crypto firms with a regulatory framework that grants a formal license. Gibraltar introduced a permissive regulatory regime for blockchain firms back in 2018 and since then, has become very attractive to leading industry companies such Huobi. Furthermore, the country became the first in Europe to develop rules governing the activities of initial coin offerings.Of course, each country has its own attitude toward cryptocurrencies; some countries do not want to accept the asset as it is, to brand it as illegal, while others create the legal framework and benefit from the fact that the cryptocurrency market makes a profit. One can only hope that sooner or later, all countries of the world will understand that cryptocurrencies are firmly entrenched in our lives, and we should accept them in one form or another. Dave Hodgson, the chief investment officer and managing director of NEM Ventures, believes that legalization will take place gradually:“We will continue to see progressive governments furthering their regulations and mechanisms for allowing citizens to utilize payment and non-payment blockchain solutions in general. The countries that have been slower to address and formalize these regulations will continue to lose business and citizens to those jurisdictions taking a more progressive approach. I believe that these economic factors will continue to incentivize the slower movers to catch up.”"
379,"The growth of the crypto derivatives market in 2020 has been a story of its own, mainly driven by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) options traded on exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Deribit, OKEx, Binance and Houbi. Record Bitcoin options volumes are indicative of an increasing institutional interest in crypto, but there are better quantitative and qualitative indicators to use, such as open interest, Bitcoin’s price, frequency of block trades, institutional Know Your Customer processes and others.Compared with traditional derivatives, the proportion of institutional investors in the entire pool is still small, but it is clear that the definitive rise in interest is driven by financial instruments such as options and futures. Options are not a panacea but rather a stage in the development of an asset, and as is evident, Bitcoin and Ether have both reached that point in their evolutions. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, echoed similar thoughts, stating that “the inflow of institutional investors money into crypto is still very nascent,” adding:“There are however various indicators signaling the gradual adoption of crypto or BTC more specifically into institutional portfolios. Traditional finance tends to prefer traditional instruments like options and futures, volumes and open interest in those instruments are clear indicators of potential growing institutional demand.”Considering only the reported volumes of Bitcoin and Ether could be misleading to investors and speculators alike, as derivatives volumes are often subject to being skewered by bots, wash trading and misreporting. A better volume indicator would be the amount of BTC moving in and out of derivatives exchanges such as Deribit. Such analytics are provided by several firms that extract insights from on-chain data.After Bitcoin options volumes saw a 1,000% rise on CME in May, derivatives volumes dropped 35.7% in June to $393 billion. However, the total option volumes for Bitcoin options on CME once again set a new record monthly high, jumping 41% with 8,444 contracts traded. Cointelegraph confirmed this increase with a CME spokesperson who provided insight on the trending open interest of BTC options, stating: “In June, CME bitcoin options had 12 consecutive days of record OI, culminating with a record 9,858 contracts (49,290 equivalent bitcoin) on June 26.”While increased volumes indicate rising interest in crypto from both the public and institutions that are trying to hedge against volatility and shelter assets during the COVID-19 pandemic and looming global financial crisis, open interest proves to be a better indicator of institutional interest, as it signifies buy-side interest and isn’t as flawed a metric to make this distinction as reported volumes would be. The spokesperson from CME agreed, saying: “In our CME Bitcoin futures market, the number of large open interest holders (LOIHs), or traders holding 25 or more contracts, grew to an average of 65 LOIHs in Q2 2020. That’s a 27% increase from Q1 and a new record. Large open interest holders are large traders as defined by the CFTC, and therefore may be another indicator of institutional participation.”Source: CMEBlock tradesBlock trades are privately negotiated futures/options contracts that meet certain quantity thresholds and are usually executed on the sidelines of the public auction market. As institutional investors and traders usually trade in higher ticket sizes, the percentage of block trades within the overall volume could also serve as an indicator of institutional interest in crypto. CME’s spokesperson further confirmed this hypothesis:“Block trading of CME Bitcoin options has grown steadily since their January 2020 launch — blocks accounted for 79% of all CME Bitcoin options volume in June, compared to 22% in April. It’s worth noting that the minimum block trade size for both CME Bitcoin futures and options is 5 contracts (equivalent to 25 Bitcoin). So increased block trading could be indicative of increased institutional participation.”To understand more about the phenomenon of block trades among crypto-exclusive exchanges, it is important to consider Deribit, as it’s the biggest platform for these instruments. In June, the biggest quarterly expiration date yet occurred, with 115,000 contracts expiring, of which Derebit maintained 74,000. Deribit’s Strijers further elaborated on the relevance of open interest and block trades, revealing:“Total BTC options market open interest was just below USD 2 billion, another record and confirmation of client interest in the asset class. We also see an increase in the relative number of BTC option block trades from 6–8% on average per month to almost 12% of the June 2020 volume.”By the end of the second quarter, BTC volatility had been markedly dampened, which in itself is a lucrative sign for institutional involvement due to institutions’ preference for stability. By comparison, retail-driven markets often see wild swings. According to Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx — a Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange — stability is a sign that “Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class,” adding in a conversation with Cointelegraph:“When institutional traders started becoming interested in BTC, volatility was a red flag that kept many away. Yet, with today’s panorama, we are seeing more volatility currently in traditional markets. This could be another reason behind the new interest from traders wanting to diversify their portfolios and finally seeing Bitcoin as a viable option for a hedge at last with a sophisticated derivatives market and options trading.”Related: Bitcoin Price Touted to End Stagnation in Style, Surging to New HighIt’s important to note that the reduced volatility of Bitcoin’s price alone is not enough to draw conclusions regarding levels of institutional involvement. John Todaro, head of research at TradeBlock — one of the largest digital currency platforms for trade executions — told Cointelegraph: “Bitcoin has had levels of dampened volatility in the past before resuming wild market swings—2018 is a good year to see this. As such, reduced volatility alone would not indicate institutional involvement.”In the recent past, Bitcoin’s price has shown a correlation with the S&P 500, which can be taken as a representative index for the global equities market. Todaro further explained on what this entails for institutional interest:“The moderate to strong correlation between equities and Bitcoin the past several months has been a good example of rising institutional interest. Large trading firms tend to push assets into directions of positive or negative correlation, which we have seen recently between Bitcoin and equities. In the past, Bitcoin has behaved very non-correlated, almost indicating a complete divorce from traditional financial markets.”Bitcoin exchange-traded funds are derivatives products that are traded using Bitcoin as their underlying assets, either fully or partially. Once the Securities and Exchange Commission approves Bitcoin ETFs, they are expected to become huge, being a watershed moment in the life cycle of BTC as an asset class and likely boosting retail demand and penetration, as revealed by Todaro: “A Bitcoin ETF in my opinion would actually increase retail trading activity given ETFs themselves are often geared for more retail like traders as a simple exposure opportunity.”Not only would this bring more retail investors in the fold, but it would also be an incentive for institutions to engage with an investment vehicle that they are very familiar with — with the SEC’s seal of approval easing institutional concerns about exposing their clients to unregulated markets. OKEx’s Hao elaborated on this: “Everyone in the space has long been awaiting the approval of a Bitcoin ETF as this will certainly increase demand from institutions as they can gain exposure for their clients to bitcoin without having to own it or deal with exchanges. They can greatly diversify their holdings without exposure to many of the risks that trading and owning BTC implies.”Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has become a force to reckon with, managing record amounts of funds and with institutions comprising 88% of its investors. Beyond this, traditional players such as the Big Four accounting firms are jumping into the crypto market, and even Western Union is making a bet. This change is also traceable on platforms such as TradeBlock, as Todaro further explained: “We have seen a considerable amount of interest from new and existing institutional traders/investment firms as they scale up in the crypto space.”Related: Two Sides of the Same Derivative: Comparing Traditional and Crypto MarketsStrijers confirmed that this interest is being seen in Deribit as well. While the company does track its institutional KYC metrics, it does not publicly publish that information. Strijers went on to say, “The number of corporate entities we service keeps growing month on month, as well as the variety of new requests received to specifically develop services for funds or discretionary asset managers.”The latest news that PayPal may allow Bitcoin payments further lends credibility to the space. And with a robust and vibrant derivatives market, plus the unprecedented uncertainty in traditional markets, this interest is likely to only grow."
380,"The COVID-19 crisis has brought many new users to the world of cryptocurrencies. One of the main concerns for users, however, is whether their bank cards may be blocked due to the purchase of a cryptocurrency, or when withdrawing funds from a crypto account. Can this risk be prevented?Since the COVID-19 outbreak and people’s subsequent desire to protect their savings, interest in cryptocurrency has continued to grow. A June 2020 survey conducted by The Tokenist found that 45% of respondents from 17 countries now prefer to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) rather than stocks, real estate or gold. For comparison’s sake, only 13% gave such an answer back in 2017.But there is a nuance to which clearly not enough attention is paid: The growth of Bitcoin’s audience is due to people who are quite unfamiliar with the crypto world. Judging by the nature of questions we have received in recent months, we realized that it is precisely the fears associated with banks blocking transactions that often stop people from active crypto investments.In our experience, there are two main categories of reasons that can lead to blocking cryptocurrency transactions. These are restrictions based on either the regulator or the acquirer.A state may impose limits and/or prohibitions on crypto operations, conversion of local currencies, and settlements or purchases in foreign currency.The most striking example of banks blocking crypto operations due to regulatory restrictions is in Argentina. In the fall of 2019, local authorities first lowered the limit on the purchase of foreign currency from $10,000 to $200 United States dollars per month.The Argentinian government then imposed a ban on the purchase of crypto with bank cards, followed by a 30% tax on purchases in foreign currency. As a result, there was no formal ban on the purchase of cryptocurrency, but local banks have been blocking such transactions.We tried to contact Argentinean banks, in particular Brubank, to find a solution for our users but received no response. In such a situation, for regulated crypto services, the only option is alternative payment systems available in the local market. Therefore, the cryptocurrency purchase transaction will be divided into two phases: a top-up of the local electronic wallet with a bank card, and then the subsequent cryptocurrency purchase from the wallet balance. Yes, such a transaction becomes more expensive, but it still ensures a safe cryptocurrency purchase. In other situations, when blocking is caused only by restrictions on settlements and purchases in a foreign currency, there is a way out: You can use a service that has configured transactions for purchasing cryptocurrencies in national currency.If the regulator, who introduces restrictions, usually thinks about the big picture of the country’s economy, then acquirers, as representatives of business, take care of their own benefits. These financial institutions try to prevent operations that are likely to be challenged as unlawful write-offs.Therefore, acquirers don’t like card transactions without 3D Secure (transaction confirmation via SMS or push notification with a one-time code). In this case, acquirers increase the cost of services and make transactions financially unprofitable, or completely transfer the responsibility for the transactions to the cryptocurrency seller.This sometimes leads to situations when, for the sake of more favorable conditions, the bank tells the acquirer that its cards support 3D Secure, when in fact, they don’t. Operations with such cards will also be blocked, like what happened recently with several banks in Mexico, reportedly mentioned by our customers.Acquirers can also restrict operations on anonymous and prepaid cards. For example, in Russia, cryptocurrency transactions from cards that do not have a holder’s name on Yandex.Money or QIWI can be blocked.Acquirers may prohibit certain types of purchases for the whole country. Recently, such a case has happened with our customers in the United Kingdom. To solve the problem, we changed the settings of our anti-fraud system and proved to the acquirer that we carefully monitor the legitimacy of the operations: We accept only 3D Secure cards; we register each user only after passing Know Your Customer; and we use technological methods to protect operations, among other steps. As you can see, the development of the crypto industry is impossible without a close interaction between the world of traditional finance and regulators. Banks in this system resemble employees from visa centers who give the right to cross the border: Some find errors in everything, while others welcome crypto users cordially. I hope that in the near future, more banks will follow the example in South Korea and become crypto-friendly.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Alex Axelrod is the founder and CEO of Aximetria and Pay Reverse.

381,"“What’s the price of those Bitcoin’s you keep talking about?” a friend asks me. I look at my phone and it’s still averaging around $9,200. “About the same as last month mate,” I replied. Bitcoin (BTC) price has hardly moved an inch in the last six weeks, barely moving 2% in either direction from its average price. Therefore, I’m starting to think it’s a stablecoin now. However, this long period of static price reminds me very much of early 2017, when Bitcoin stayed around $900 for the first three months of the year, which was followed by an explosive 300% move in the second quarter, and then just kept going.  Daily crypto market performance. Source: Coin360.comThe question on my mind now is whether we can genuinely expect anything like that to happen in 2020 now that half the year is behind us, or whether Bitcoin has simply topped out and is waiting to drop.  We all know that the first quarter of 2020 was brutal for Bitcoin. However, after the Black Thursday dump in March, those lucky people that bought at the bottom have already seen a whopping 180% ROI on their investment.   It would be naive of anyone to not expect some of those people to be taking profit, so a period of consolidation is a completely natural thing to expect.  However, what makes BTC very different from other assets is the position the miners are finding themselves in. They have 50% less Bitcoin to sell than before, and the effect of the consolidation following the mini bull-run has put BTC/USD in a downward trend.   BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Bitcoin is less than 1% away from breaking out of this downward channel. The current price of Bitcoin is sitting at just under $9,300 and the resistance of the descending channel on the daily is a mere $9,350.  This also puts the mid-channel support around $8,900, and the final support before signaling a greater move down at $8,350. From here, all hope of an immediate bull run would be lost. Zooming out to the weekly chart for Bitcoin, and drawing Fibonacci lines using the 2017 ATH peak to the 2019 bottom, we can see that BTC has been hovering around the 0.382 Fib for several weeks, sometimes crossing up, and sometimes crossing down.  BTC/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingView With Fibonacci trading, you look at the next levels as potential targets, and typically once the 0.382 has been broken after rising through 0.236, the next level is the 0.5 or 50% Fib, which sits at $11,500.  If the 0.382 of $9,250 can become support in the upcoming week, then bears are in for a bad time. Conversely, if the support of $8,350 fails to hold, it’s a long way down for Bitcoin to go to find new support on the 0.236, which puts the downside target at $7,000. BTC/USD 1-week MACD chart Source: TradingViewIn last week's technical analysis, the weekly MACD was looking very “weak” and due to cross bearishly. A cross up or down on the weekly MACD are pivotal points for Bitcoin. You only need to look through the history of the price action compared to the MACD to see that it’s the only indicator you need to time your buying and selling of Bitcoin. However, thanks to last week's mini-alt season, it seems the interest in Bitcoin is picking up, and this is reflected by the blue MACD line changing its trajectory from down to up. When the MACD blows open like this on lower time frames, it’s a trader’s worst nightmare if they had failed to wait for confirmation as it’s a very early sign of a trend reversal. In other words, Bitcoin bulls are not ready to capitulate to the bears just yet.  Tether Market Cap Source: Coin360Normally during periods of consolidation, Bitcoin traders have the choice of parking their realized profits into Tether, affording them the luxury to buy the dip with ease or to re-enter on confirmation of a bullish reversal. However, in a recent article in Forbes about a formal investigation into Tether and its fast approach towards a $10 billion market cap in the wake of Brock Pierce recently announcing his intentions of running for president of the United States, I for one would be nervous holding any amount of USDT right now.  As such, it seems likely that a large chunk of that $10 billion parked in Tether would logically start heading into Bitcoin and top-tier altcoins. This would explain the recent surge in altcoins, as well as affecting the outlook for Bitcoin in the immediate future.If the price of Bitcoin can push past $9,350, there are a few key areas of resistance that must be overcome before $11,500 can be reached. First, there is a large sell wall around $9,500 on Binance, according to the Tensorcharts heatmap. After this level, attacking the multiyear resistance level of $10,500 looks like it could be back on the cards, and with all the Tether fud, this is a scenario that looks quite promising. Orderbook heatmap. Source: TensorchartsUsing the same Tensorcharts heatmap, there’s a huge buy order ahead of the $8,900 support at $8,990. Should this level fail to hold I would be looking at $8,350 as the next level for the descending channel on the daily to stay intact.  Breaking below $8,350 could open up $7K BTC as a stark reality in the short term. However, with Tether potentially off the table in the short term, I doubt the bears will have a good week.

382,"It’s been another good, stable week for Bitcoin. No big breakout yet but also no sudden collapse and a comfortable rise of around 1.6 percent. If that sounds like Bitcoin is becoming a bit predictable, don’t rest too easy. Some analysts see this sideways period as the prelude to a big move—either up or down. Other analysts, though, are more positive. They see Bitcoin in the same place that Apple was in pre-iPhone days. They think it could reach $60,000 by 2023. If that happens, participants in a new German guerrilla marking campaign will be doing a lot of people some valuable favors. The Ideas Are Like Flames collective is distributing stickers extolling Bitcoin and urging people to adopt “freedom money.” Participants can even receive 675 Satoshis for every sticker they stick.But maybe they should be buying Dogecoin instead. That’s something that TikTok users are doing. Buying Dogecoin has become a trend with TikTok users telling each other they could make a fortune if the price hits a buck. The new demand quickly pushed up the price of the coin by 20 percent and it’s now more than double the price it was at the start of the week.

The company has ceased all the crypto-related transactions, however, users were reportedly not affected by this hack.The company suspects that the hackers are based in east Delhi, India. The company claims it has filed a cybercrime incident report to the Delhi crime bureau with acknowledgment number 20807200031555 under the cryptocurrency crime category.Cashaa suspects a piece of malware was installed onto the system that facilitated exchange transfers, such as user withdrawals. The malware notified the hacker when an employee logged into the account on July 10 and made two transfers from the wallet. Cashaa was using a Blockchain.com wallet to store and send BTC. Exchange CEO Kumar Gaurav said to Cointelegraph:“We are still investigating the damage caused by the incident and suspend all the withdrawals for 24 hours. We have called the board meeting to decide whether the company will bear all the losses.”Cashaa says it’s trying not to allow hackers to sell the Bitcoin on exchanges. In a tweet, the company also provided the Bitcoin address of the hackers.Some crypto exchanges have said that they will extend support to Cashaa in monitoring the addresses and report any suspicious transactions. FOr example, Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of WazirX cryptocurrency exchange, told Cointelegraph that “we will help Cashaa in all the manner and also working on setting up certain security standards for exchanges,” adding: “WazirX will ensure that we lock any funds that reach us from the hacked wallet. We have informed the Binance team as well.”"
384,"Only with increasing difficulty can one recall a time when the majority of the world was yet to adopt the internet. In 1995, user adoption of the internet had only reached 10% of American households, five years after the very first web browser was launched. Another five years later, in the year 2000, 50% of the United States nation had already adopted the internet.Imagining today’s world without internet is simply unfathomable and, in the future, the same will be said about cryptocurrency. The technologies fostered by the crypto industry are often considered the most disruptive and paradigm-shifting advancements since the birth of the internet itself. They are quickly transforming the way people interact, trade, and gain autonomy of their own wealth and assets.In the early 90s, internet adoption was slow. Newly developed networks struggled with concerns of scalability, privacy and ease of use. Today, we are witnessing these same key issues with cryptocurrencies and blockchains. In order to accelerate mainstream adoption, we must wear the hat of a user experience designer, because only then will we see cryptocurrencies reach their full potential across the globe.Crypto is no simple concept. The industry is trying to squeeze a new technology into traditional patterns of finance. This may be easy for some, but definitely not for the majority.Firstly, it’s important to communicate why there are key differences between traditional fiat money, such as euros, dollars, pounds, etc., and crypto, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), etc. Most people don’t understand that Bitcoin is a decentralized and global digital currency not backed by a central entity and immune to government interference.This year, the United States Federal Reserve pumped trillions of dollars into the nation’s economy, which will have consequences at a later date when inflation inevitably rises. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a limited supply. With a set maximum, it is anti-inflationary. This means that over time, it increases in value.Nodes and hash rate aside, we need to better educate the public on how understanding and adopting cryptocurrency does not need to be complicated. What holds many people back is their lack of understanding of things like crypto wallets and private keys. But we need to explain to users that using crypto is easy, accessible and highly beneficial.At the same time, it’s important to communicate that this is not just a crypto versus traditional banking scenario — banks and institutions are also integrating cryptocurrencies into their systems. We are all adopting crypto together.Many cryptocurrency exchanges are building strong relationships with banks across the world, and a variety of traditional institutions are also educating their users on the many advantages of crypto. Take PwC for example, which publishes a yearly Crypto Hedge Fund Report that aims to encourage the adoption of sound practices as this innovative space matures. Meanwhile, banks like ING are regularly investing in research to educate their users on the “money revolution.”What’s holding back a large majority of people from entering this space is the perceived complexities of onboarding. Right now, it is those who understand the inner workings of cryptocurrency technology that are reaping the benefits of its value. New users should not be excluded just because they lack the awareness of how to access more than one form of finance.Users need to feel confident that even if they use Bitcoin, a stablecoin or another cryptocurrency, they can exchange their funds for fiat at their convenience. Crypto debit cards now serve as a solution to meet this demand. Cash can be just as easily accessed from a crypto ATM as it is from a traditional bank account holding fiat.New users lack the confidence that this is possible. We need to help them become comfortable with purchasing and trading crypto, which is why onboarding users with easy-to-use applications is key. The beauty of crypto is being able to access different types of currencies all in the one place.It is up to the crypto community to simplify the process of onboarding by making it as convenient as accessing traditional finance from an everyday bank. Do email users need to understand the inner workings of their email systems? No. All they need to know is that it is a reliable communication tool. Helping users understand the process is essential to a positive onboarding experience. The process must be intuitive, and it must make sense.For users to adopt crypto, there must be a need for it. What’s the point of transitioning to a new kind of money if my existing bank account does the job? What is the need in the market for learning and adopting new forms of finance?It took a worldwide pandemic, intensified political conflict and other macroeconomic factors for people to realize we have less control over our own finances than we thought. Traditional fiat can be invested and spent in ways that are out of our control, through decisions that are often detrimental to others. We know too well from past financial crises that we cannot control the value of our money when it is in traditional fiat. Cryptocurrencies offer greater autonomy over where we choose to invest, bringing financial control back to the people.Crypto also provides users with the power to earn back crypto on purchases through a new ecosystem of “cryptoback” reward systems. It is only now that we are seeing more attractive membership and cashback benefits that have been missing from crypto since the birth of the currency, but it is important to match what traditional fiat has to offer and go a level further. Traditional fiat reward systems usually reimburse “rewards” that are often limited to airline miles and other reward systems.Crypto cashback, on the other hand, offers the opportunity to earn a percentage of your transaction value back in Bitcoin. When it is more attractive to hold rather than spend Bitcoin, creating reward systems like crypto cashbacks without the need to visit the bank makes crypto adoption more intuitive.These kinds of currencies are also borderless — if you can access an ATM that takes MasterCard or Visa, then you can access your finances. This significantly lowers the fees of cross-border transactions and makes accessing your money instant wherever you are.Mainstream Bitcoin adoption is inevitable, and those who are late to the party may miss out on purchasing these in-demand assets at affordable investment levels. Cryptocurrency exchanges offer an opportunity for users to access a variety of currencies from stablecoins over fiat to cryptocurrencies, improving the accessibility of greater financial freedom and multi-currency trade.Communicating this will be key. How we shape the experience for new users will determine the speed of Bitcoin adoption by mainstream finance. Everyone deserves the right to access these transformative forms of finance.

385,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been showing weakness throughout the week. However, the key support level is holding up, and this triggered the continuation of many altcoins such as Tezos (XTZ) and Algorand (ALGO), which are soaring on July 11, gaining over 9% and 17%, respectively. The massive surges in altcoin price usually occur when Bitcoin remains calm and this is what we have seen happening in the previous two months. The question is how long will this last and is the top-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization ready for a renewed test of the $10,000 resistance level?Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360BTC USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe structure is still intact, as the necessary conclusion comes around the corner. However, the price of Bitcoin has been showing weakness throughout the week. The first one is the crucial upwards trend. This trend remains to be active, as long as the market is continually making higher lows. It’s essential that Bitcoin keeps the $8,500-$8,800 support level on higher time frames. If that level is lost, a chain reaction of stop/loss triggers could occur. However, on a lower time frame, the same can be stated of the $9,000-$9,100 level acting around the trendline. Second, the market is acting above the 100-day and 200-day moving average and that’s a bullish signal as this implies bull territory. Furthermore, both of these MA’s are coming into play sooner than later. These MAs can act as support which will be pushing the price further up.Finally, by defining a renewed higher low, the RSI oscillator made a hidden bullish divergence, which suits a repeated test of the resistance zone at $10,000.BTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour gives a clear explanation of the recent range-bound movements. The $9,400 level is acting as resistance, while the crucial support at $9,000-$9,100 is holding up as support. This range can sustain for several days as the price is stuck in between these levels. However, the conflict in the markets occurs as the price has been making lower highs since the peak of June 1. It’s crucial that bulls manage a breakthrough of the $9,400 resistance level, through which a retest of the $9,600 resistance block is likely to occur. A breakthrough of $9,600 means continuation to the $10,000 resistance level is possible and if this level is tested again, a breakout becomes more and more likely. If bears are to take control of Bitcoin price, first the $9,000-$9,100 support level must be lost as then the higher lows construction will be erased.Total crypto market capitalization 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe total crypto market capitalization chart is showing a steady picture. Remarkably, the chart is making a new higher high, while Bitcoin is lagging and has yet to make a new higher high.This shows that altcoins have been in the spotlight recently, as they’ve gained more momentum and market capitalization. Next to that, the chart shows a hidden bullish divergence showing up on the chart next to the support at $240 billion.Further compression is likely to occur before a new impulse to the upside occurs rather than a further downside. BTC USD 1-day bullish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewAs discussed earlier, the $9,000-$9,100 area was a crucial pivot to hold. Luckily for the bulls, the market has held for support, through which the bullish scenario can be designed.The $9,000-$9,100 area needs to hold through which the uptrend sustains. As long as this uptrend is sustaining, the momentum is upwards and a $9,600 test can occur. This $9,600 resistance level is untested and ripe for a test of the markets. If the price of Bitcoin rejects at this resistance level, the next target area for support is the $9,300 zone. If that structure continues to unfold, then a renewed test of the $10,000 area is likely to occur. Thus, a repeated test of the $10,000-$10,500 area would lead to a possible breakout upwards.The bearish scenario is pretty straightforward and has some crucial pivots to watch. BTC USD 1-day bearish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe crucial pivots are another rejection at the $9,400 level leading toward a double-top confirmation and a potential trend reversal. Such a rejection would create another lower high and warrant further downward pressure. If that occurs, it’s likely to see a renewed test of the $9,000-$9,100 level. However, the more often an important level gets tested, the more likely a break will occur.The major pivot to watch for is the breakdown of the $9,000-$9,100 level. If that occurs, the volume should show up with a chain reaction of stop/loss triggers going off. A drop toward the $8,500-$8,600 area is likely after which a bearish rejection of that $9,000-$9,100 level would warrant further downward momentum. Similarly, if such a drop occurs, the 100-day and 200-day MA’s are lost, and the market is likely to start seeking the 100-week and 200-week MA’s for support. The first major support level is found between $7,500-$7,700 if the market drops below the range support of this two-month consolidation range. If that doesn’t occur, the market is ready for further upwards and range-bound movements. As the chart is showing, these movements can happen until the end of August. This would suit altcoins relatively well as they can continue basking in the spotlight. But remember, if Bitcoin looks to be making a volatile move shortly, then altcoins will suffer.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

386,"A recent article by a Cointelegraph Markets contributor proclaimed that “Bitcoin is the ‘new’ Apple,” explaining just how Bitcoin’s (BTC) price could reach $60,000 by 2023: “Bitcoin hangs near the chasm of the adoption curve, and its price looks similar to Apple’s stock in 2008 before it broke out with a 520% rally.” The technology adoption curve referenced was Everett Rogers’ famous “diffusion of innovations” model, published in 1962, which described the five stages through which technology becomes “diffused” — i.e., goes mainstream: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. In 2008, manufacturer Apple’s United States smartphone penetration was stalled at about 11% and still waiting to cross the “chasm,” the gap between the “early adopter” stage and the “early majority” stages in the Rogers lexicon. Any technical innovation worth its salt needs to cross that threshold. Apple’s smartphone surmounted that chasm, of course: Usage exploded, and Apple’s share price soared into the ionosphere. Bitcoin may well be in a similar place today.But this comparison, satisfying as it may be, raises some questions. Is BTC even a technology — like radios, PCs, and smartphones — or is it something different: unique, sui generis — i.e., in a class by itself? Is BTC’s global penetration really anywhere close to 11% — its putative U.S. penetration rate? Also, while smartphone usage indubitably crossed the chasm more than a decade ago, how does one extrapolate BTC’s future price from AAPL’s share price? Shouldn’t it be compared with smartphones’ price? The resemblance between Bitcoin and Apple in terms of growth and adoption is indeed there, but in short, is it fair to compare Bitcoin to younger versions of tech giants like Apple?Arvind Singhal, a professor of communication at the University of Texas at El Paso, whose academic research has focused on the diffusion of innovation, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin did indeed seem singular: “It has tremendous barriers to adoption for most individuals and operates in a space of multiple familiar currencies — and that peculiarity would greatly influence its adoption.”Michel Rauchs, the head of Paradigma — a consulting firm focusing on the digital assets sector — and a former research affiliate for the cryptocurrency and blockchain research program at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge, told Cointelegraph: “Bitcoin is not a technology in itself, and any comparison [with traditional technologies] is misguided.” He added: “It is a social/economic system,” a new monetary order that uses technology to represent its unit of accounts. “Technology is just a secondary component, a means to an end.”Additionally, it may be important here to separate Bitcoin from the more generalized blockchain technology in which it partakes — or risk misapplying Rogers’s diffusion of innovation theory — suggested Theophanis Stratopoulos, PwC Chair Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo’s School of Accounting and Finance, who further explained to Cointelegraph:“When decision-makers consider whether to implement blockchain — in, let’s say, their supply chain — they develop expectations in terms of the cost of making the investment — e.g., paying for the implementation of the software — versus the benefits, such as increased revenues or cost savings. It is the difference in expectations among decision-makers that explains the adoption cycle that was observed by Rogers.”But Bitcoin does not behave the same way as other technologies typically adopted by firms — like CRM systems, for instance. “When it comes to Bitcoin, it’s the expected price that drives people to ‘invest’ in Bitcoin.” It is a matter of speculation, Stratopoulos continued, closer to a pyramid scheme than a capital expenditure. “If I believe that more people will want to hold Bitcoin in the future, the price of the Bitcoin will rise. In a case like this, it makes sense for me to ‘invest’ today rather than tomorrow.”Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, the CEO and founder of the BCB Group — a digital assets financial services group — agreed that BTC’s adoption cycle was anomalous, telling Cointelegraph: “The reason Bitcoin’s adoption path has broken formation with established adoption curves is quite technical: In the short term, the more users there are, the less useful it is as a currency.”With more users, the Bitcoin network “self-regulates by raising the network fees as the mem pool bulges up in busy periods and breathes out in quieter ones.” But this makes Bitcoin less effective as a payments processing system. As von Landsberg-Sadie explained: “When fees are high, no one is going to pay a $5 transaction fee on a $5 coffee.”Many technical solutions have been proposed to solve this dilemma, some in the form of forks, others like the Lightning Network project that makes use of a second layer, “but none have truly stuck in the core Bitcoin protocol, which has been the slowest to evolve.” The good news is that it is evolving, and the increase in off-chain transactions is reducing barriers, but all of this means one can’t expect Bitcoin to follow a classic Rogers technical adoption curve, according to von Landsberg-Sadie.When U.S. smartphone penetration stalled at around the 11% mark in December 2008, Apple’s share price became volatile — three-month volatility stood at 92%, according to the July 6 Cointelegraph article. In June 2020, with BTC penetration at 11%, three-month volatility was at 64%, indeed also a very high figure. But Stratopoulos was unimpressed. “I would not compare Bitcoin to the performance of Apple or Amazon or any other high-tech company. Rogers’s adoption cycle applies to innovations — emerging technologies — not to the price of stock.” Kevin Dowd, a professor of finance and economics at Durham University in the United Kingdom, agreed, telling Cointelegraph: “Since BTC is a form of product, then the natural comparison is with Apple’s smartphone product. Apple’s share price might have risen strongly, but the better comparison is with the price of smartphones, which have not.”“It is relatively easy to find correlations” — like between AAPL in 2008 and BTC in 2020, commented Stratopoulos. “It does not mean that there is causation,” or it could be just a spurious correlation. What, then, can be said about Bitcoin adoption? If measured by awareness — e.g., recognition of the term Bitcoin — “then it has already entered the mainstream,” said Rauchs. A Blockchain Capital survey reported 89% awareness of Bitcoin in the U.S. as of Spring 2019. A U.K. Financial Conduct Authority survey conducted in December 2019, which was recently published, found that 73% have heard about crypto, compared to 58% in 2019. As for BTC ownership, the Blockchain Capital survey reported: “In total, 9% of the [U.S] population owns Bitcoin — including 18% of those aged 18–34 and 12% of those aged 35–44.” The firm originally reported 11% but that was later corrected. In the U.K. survey, by comparison, an estimated “3.86% of the general population currently own cryptocurrencies.” This projects to approximately 1.9 million adults within the U.K. population (over 18) of roughly 50 million.Rauchs finds the lower U.K. adoption estimate “more realistic” if generalizing; that is, he would peg crypto ownership at 3%–5% of the global population, which also includes indirect ownership — e.g., individuals participating in a pension fund that invests in Bitcoin. But this clearly means that all crypto is in the first half of the early adopter stage — nowhere near the so-called chasm. It’s not much different for blockchain technology. Stratopoulos co-authored a paper on blockchain technology adoption — exclusive of cryptocurrencies — that concluded: “Despite the recent hype, the current adoption rate is relatively low, and blockchain has not become mainstream yet.”Bitcoin clearly means different things to different people. “It’s most popular use today is as a store of value, while back in 2011, its principal use was as a payment method — for gaming” and other purposes, said Rauchs. Depending on its applications, different adoption curve scenarios are possible. For his part, Rauchs believes that BTC’s most likely future usage will be as an alternative, non-sovereign store of value.According to von Landsberg-Sadie, Bitcoin’s true adoption pattern will be “more like a wave, oscillating higher at each cycle.” In this view, “the biggest bets are on the most extreme outcomes: Bitcoin will either ripple slowly out of relevance, or it will amplify meaningfully into the mainstream. My money is on the latter.”In sum, BTC following the same growth pattern as Apple sounds like a fun version of what may happen, but ultimately, one shouldn’t quibble that it is “not based on a statistically valid experiment,” as Dowd reminded Cointelegraph. Still, according to several experts, it doesn’t make sense to compare Bitcoin to traditional technologies “because Bitcoin does not have the ability to create value — either in the form of increasing revenues or reducing costs,” as Stratopoulous noted. Moreover, global BTC penetration is arguably closer to 4% than to the 11% mark where smartphones stood in 2008, immediately before they went mainstream."
387,"The Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) — a self-regulatory organization for the crypto industry in Japan — recently published a report on Japanese holdings of major cryptocurrencies in March. 169,376 BTC was held on Japanese exchanges, up more than 11% from the previous month. XRP was up 6.4% to 3.2 billion XRP. Ether was up more than 5.7% to 1.14 million ETH. Moreover, the number of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Monacoin (MONA), Litecoin (LTC), and NEM (XEM) also increased slightly in March. The volume of Bitcoin spot trading was 617.3 billion yen (about $5.8 billion) in March, 11 times more than the trading volume of XRP, the second-most traded cryptocurrency that same month.In March, Bitcoin was down more than 25%. It started the month at around $8,600 dollars but on March 12, known as “Black Thursday”, it briefly plummeted below $5,000. Bitcoin ended the month near $6,400. The reason Japanese investors increased their crypto holdings is not immediately clear. One could say Japanese Bitcoin believers were not hesitant to buy more after the collapse of the crypto market. It may be also the case that Japanese investors were sending more cryptocurrencies to exchanges to sell, the opposite case of Bitcoin being withdrawn from Coinbase recently. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Yuya Hasegawa, a market analyst at the FSA licensed crypto exchange Bitbank, explained that usually price movement and user’s holdings of cryptocurrency are “correlated inversely”. He continued to analyze as follows:“In the time of downward price movement, you can say that users send cryptos to exchanges for the purposes of taking profits or loss cutting. Another reason might be a Japan premium in the BTC market compared with the US dollar-based market after March 12th”Investors worldwide accumulated cryptocurrencies during the corona pandemic. According to U.K. crypto trading app Mode, Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964), and Generation-X (born 1965-1980) investors increased their monthly Bitcoin investment since the start of the pandemic.Mode chief product officer Janis Legler observed that their findings “could potentially reveal an unprecedented change in the way investors think today, as a result of the global pandemic."""
388,"According to data from CoinMetrics, a sell-off on Bitstamp led the market-wide plunge of Bitcoin (BTC). The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped $150 within seconds on the exchange, well below the average market price at the time.Researchers at CoinMetrics said:“Today's market drop was led by trade activity on Bitstamp, where Bitcoin's price dropped $150 in seconds, well below the rest of the market.”The price of Bitcoin drops lower on Bitstamp than other exchanges on July 10. Source: CoinMetricsThe sell-off on Bitstamp coincided with a sudden dump of BTC by miners. ByteTree shows miners sold 558 more BTC than they mined in the last 24 hours. This suggests that miners led the correction of Bitcoin on July 9, possibly trading on Bitstamp.Miners are one of the two external sources of unmatched selling pressure on Bitcoin, as investor Willy Woo previously explained.When miners begin to sell BTC — and the market does not immediately absorb the selling pressure — it can lead to an abrupt pullback. That is what likely happened on July 10 when the price of BTC dropped to around $9,100 from $9,400.Throughout the past month, miners have been selling a modest amount of BTC regularly. But miners have always maintained a positive net inventory for over five straight weeks. In other words, miners have been selling less BTC than they mined since the start of June.As miners started to sell a relatively large amount of Bitcoin for the first time in over a month, BTC saw a rapid, short-term price drop.Miners sold off an unusually large amount of Bitcoin in the last 24 hours. Source: ByteTreeAlthough the sell-off primarily occurred on Bitstamp, the firm’s executive emphasized that it was not a flash crash. Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. operations at the exchange, said it was merely a normal market activity.Merghart said:“Happy to see market moves analyzed but not sure a ~2% move should be called a flash crash. This is also how markets work, especially when an exchange doesn't act as a market maker. We let our clients try to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, not ourselves.”Simply put, sellers on Bitstamp likely kickstarted the unexpected 2% price drop of Bitcoin followed by organic selling pressure from traders and clients on the exchange.After the price of BTC dropped to around $9,110 across major exchanges, it rebounded quickly to above $9,200.The swift rebound of Bitcoin might suggest that a sudden sell-off on Bitstamp — possibly by miners — triggered the drop. Based on the reaction of buyers in the $9,000 to $9,100 support area, the probability of a continued recovery of BTC price remains high.If a one-off event caused a BTC drop to a level that presents significant liquidity for buyers, the probability of a strong reaction from bulls might increase.Cryptocurrency trader Michael van de Poppe wrote:“Bitcoin is still holding support above the $9,000 barrier. A breakthrough further of $9,300 could lead toward $9,600. Essentially, anything between $8,500 and $10,500 is playground time for altcoins and that could last a few months longer.”In the near-term, traders generally consider the $9,300 level to be a strong area of resistance. A reclaim of $9,300 is likely to see a retest of the high-$9Ks, analysts say."
389,"Hurricanes and typhoons, earthquakes, cyberattacks and solar flares: There are many disasters, both natural and human-made, that have the potential to disrupt our digital-centric societies. With an estimated 4.5 billion people using the internet, many communicate with cell phones and email, while financially transacting using credit cards, apps and ATMs. But each of these critical services is dependent on a reliable connection to the internet and a continuous source of electricity — both of which are typically unavailable after a disaster.As the planet continues to warm due to human-caused climate change, the risk to infrastructure only continues to grow. Rising sea levels will lead to increased coastal flooding that will put more energy generation facilities at risk, and as the globe’s food and water supplies are disrupted by changing weather patterns, international conflict may bring consequences yet unforeseen.Luckily, after a catastrophic disaster, it is still technologically possible to both communicate with friends and family and take advantage of Bitcoin’s (BTC) resilient global financial network. In fact, even if the global internet network is no longer available, it is still possible to stay connected. The solution lies in decentralized and distributed local networks known as mesh networks, which could serve as the technological backbone of a disaster-ravaged future.A mesh network is a decentralized and distributed local network, often powered using WiFi or Bluetooth connections, in which all the “nodes” on the network connect to each other directly. Each node connects to all other nodes within range, allowing for data to “hop” from node to node, shared with everyone connected to the mesh. Nodes can also serve as access points to the network, meaning that if a node is set up with a WiFi access point, people can connect to the mesh using any device that is WiFi-capable. If individual nodes are solar-powered, a mesh network can theoretically operate for an indefinite period of time.Such networks present a number of benefits during disasters, allowing people to communicate locally. If just one node has access to the global internet, it can share that access with all other users of the network. As Greta Byrum, director of the Digital Equity Laboratory at the New School and co-director of Community Tech NY — a group that works to educate communities on mesh networking — told Cointelegraph:“If you lose connection to the internet, you can still share information around in the local area among the network nodes. You do need to have a server that is able to host the data, and then you can route it around your local network.”In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy swept through New York City, leaving behind an estimated $19 billion in damages and lost economic activity in its wake. The Brooklyn neighborhood of Red Hook saw widespread power outages and flooding after the storm, taking many people offline. The nonprofit Red Hook Initiative still had electricity and was able to keep a free WiFi hotspot up and running. Soon, up to 300 people per day were accessing the RedHookWiFi network to connect and communicate, with volunteers expanding the network by adding additional routers and software to the mesh, such as an app that let users text their location and needs, which were then automatically plotted on a map.Now, the RedHookWiFi project consists of a 35-node mesh WiFi network, with local businesses, residences and community organizations all pitching in to provide real estate for its routers. Five of the nodes are solar-powered, and the network’s servers have been backed up in a physical location outside of the neighborhood as well as in the cloud, according to Steve Amarante, a partner at Sky-Packets — the IT company that helps to maintain the network. He added that as the network continues to grow, “future plans call for additional power resiliency in the form of battery cells and additional data redundancy.”In the short term, the goal of the project is to bring free WiFi into a nearby public housing project to increase residents’ personal resiliency, according to Javier Lopez, chief strategy officer of the Red Hook Initiative. He told Cointelegraph that in the event of another catastrophic disaster, “We aim to keep the network running and hosting various messages and updates during its log on splash page. Once logged on they will be [able to] go to school, work, play, connect to family (just like any normal connection).”But what if there are no resources for enterprise-grade servers, or what if a commercially installed network is destroyed? Luckily, mesh networks can be assembled together in a do-it-yourself fashion and deployed anywhere to create an entirely off-grid communications network. All one needs to get started is a WiFi router, a small computer such as a Raspberry Pi to act as a server, some cables, a battery and solar charger — according to New America, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that was active in helping New York City to construct mesh networks in multiple coastal neighborhoods following the hurricane. In a zine developed to teach people how to assemble DIY mesh WiFi hotspots, the think tank describes the benefits of such technology, for example stating that: “A local network can serve as a ‘micro-internet’ in some of these scenarios.”Byrum, who previously directed New America’s Resilient Communities program that released the zine, told Cointelegraph that such DIY networks are currently being used in COVID-19 pandemic recovery efforts. In rural Tennessee, residents without internet access are able to receive telehealth services from a clinic that has suspended in-person visits, and in Kingston, New York, a pop-up COVID-19 testing center is being powered by an old news broadcasting van with a built-in local network access point. “The whole thing is solar-powered,” Byrum said, adding: “It’s a mobile solar-powered WiFi van that has a 40-foot arm to stick the WiFi antenna up.”Historically, cash has been king in a disaster, but as society moves into an increasingly digital world, this may not stay the case. If electricity is knocked out in a disaster, so too are credit card readers, digital payment terminals and ATMs. Once the backup batteries of cell towers die, cell phones will turn into mere flashlights and clocks. Even when there is no disaster, payment systems can crash, such as in June 2018 when Visa’s global payment network went down in Europe.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin offer highly resilient financial networks, as they are globally distributed and thus less vulnerable to disruptions. There is no centralized facility or server that can fail and bring the entire network down. As such, the Bitcoin network has been operational for 99.99% of its existence since inception. However, even if the network is up and running, without the internet, transactions cannot be added to the blockchain, which effectively means that crypto cannot be used.Thankfully, the same mesh networks can also power on-chain transactions. As previously stated, one of the major benefits of a mesh network is that just one node needs access to the internet for all nodes to share in that access.Related: Offline Transactions: The Final Frontier for Global Crypto AdoptionThe developer known as “Grubles” demonstrated in January 2019 how one can broadcast a transaction through a mesh network to be added to the blockchain. The developer set up a Bitcoin full node connected to a satellite receiver that obtained blockchain data via the Blockstream satellite network. They then used an Electrum Wallet, the TxTenna app developed by decentralized communication tech company GoTenna, and a GoTenna Mesh device to send it through a mesh network until it was able to be broadcast. Once it was added to the blockchain, Grubles verified the transaction through the data downloaded from his so-called “satnode.”Another developer by the name of “Nixops” claimed in September 2018 to have completed an off-grid “proof-of-life” transaction on the Burst blockchain by using a mesh network to send data packets via amateur radio bands. More recently, Venezuela-based startup Locha Mesh announced that it is developing off-grid hardware devices that will connect to a phone or laptop to broadcast crypto transaction information over a mesh network strung together using ultra high-frequency radio waves. Once the transaction hops to a device connected to the internet, the data is broadcasted and added to the blockchain.Within any one person’s lifetime, the chances of being subject to a disaster catastrophic enough to wipe out the power grid, global terrestrial internet and satellite network are extremely slim. However, a huge solar storm is one disaster that might be worth staying up at night to worry about. Such an event is statistically inevitable and has already occurred once — possibly twice — within the past 150-odd years. In fact, Earth saw a near miss of such a storm in 2012.So, in a world in which any sort of global network is no longer possible to maintain, is there any hope for rebuilding a digital economy? The answer is: Yes — mesh networks could theoretically provide the backbone for an internetless, regional, crypto-based community. But in reality, it’s not so simple. According to Byrum, any service that uses the global internet can, theoretically, be replicated on a local network — albeit in a more limited capacity. “It’s really different to be in a chat room with your neighbors just talking about food and water,” she said, “That’s a really different experience than, ‘I’ve got memes and GIFs.’”Rieki Cordon, a facilitator for Seeds — a crypto platform that seeks to build the foundation for sustainable communities — told Cointelegraph that operating a local blockchain would be possible and might provide some value for logging economic activity, but in such an event, utilizing blockchain would be the last thing on anyone’s mind. Neighborhoods can embrace blockchain and crypto now, before a disaster occurs, in order to build strong communities that are inherently more resilient, adding:“Use this technology to generate new forms of wealth and use that to create circular economies and local food systems. Use decentralized governance so people can start learning how to make decisions and create together. [...] Then if a catastrophic event shuts the technological system down, the community is more capable of handling it. The food they planted, the infrastructure for local need production and community bonds they created in the process will remain and ultimately prove more valuable than any blockchain or crypto-network.”While mesh networks and access to crypto can undoubtedly help to power neighborhoods during even the most catastrophic of disasters, one thing is clear: Technology is useless without people who know how to use it and communities that have already organized around it. Byrum told Cointelegraph that mesh networks “could absolutely be key to rebuilding, but it’s also the knowledge,” adding, “The equipment and the software/firmware — it doesn’t do you any good if you don’t have the skills.”Indeed, preparedness is considered to be one of the four fundamental stages of a disaster’s life cycle. In a truly catastrophic disaster, it could take years to fully rebuild infrastructure, supply chains and the economy. For Cordon, the idea of building sustainable, crypto-based communities is directly connected with disaster preparedness, but the technology itself is not what’s important:“We can use this technology to transition our civilization and address humanity’s greatest crises — every step we take in that direction helps us become more prepared for the crises to come.”"
390,"When I began to get interested in trading, about 20 years ago, I read many books on the topic. One day, I saw: “In order to make money in the markets, the importance is not to lose.” Duh! — did I tell myself while reading… only later to discover the real meaning behind that catchy phrase, which I have since applied when trading, and to a great benefit.In order to understand the true meaning of, “In order to make money in the markets, the importance is to not lose,” one has to remember what Albert Einstein famously said about compound interests being the most powerful force in the universe:“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it… he who doesn’t … pays it.”Compound interests work both ways: when compounded positively, they can bring tremendous growth, but when compounded negatively, they can lead to disastrous losses. Therefore, in order to recover from a loss, the gain to breakeven grows exponentially with the magnitude of the loss.For example, a loss of 10% requires a gain of just 11% to recover, a loss of 25% requires a strong gain of 33% to recover, while a loss of 30% (not much bigger than the previous 25% loss) requires a gain of 43% (much higher than the 33% needed to recover from a 25% loss), etc. A loss of 50% requires a gain of 100% to recover, and typically, a loss of 60% or more in the markets are almost unrecoverable.Markets tend to fall much faster than they rise. Compound that (no pun intended) with the compounding interests effect on the negative side, and one can easily see the problem, which is two-fold:Traditional financial markets: The 2000–2002 decline erased the entire total return of the S&P 500 — in excess of Treasury bills — all the way back to May 1996, while the 2007–2009 financial crisis wiped out the entire excess return of the S&P 500 all the way back to June 1995.Crypto markets: From January 2016 to June 2020, Bitcoin (BTC) peaked at 83.7%, which requires a gain of 512% to fully recover. As at June 30, 2020, Bitcoin had only recovered 187%, still a long way to go to break even despite having almost tripled in value.It then appeared more clearly to me that “In order to make money in the markets, the importance is not to lose” meant: One has to keep losses small, as the bigger they are, the harder it is to recover.Trading is, in fact, all about risk management.When entering a position, people bet on a direction (either up or down) in which the market may turn, usually over a predetermined time frame with an expected probability above 50%. However, in reality, the probability of making the right call is often less, typically in the 30%–40% range for a successful trader.This means that a trader will be wrong 60% to 70% of the time, whereas the initial expectation was less than 50% of the time, hence the need to focus on controlling losses that occur more often than one expects.By the same token, winning positions will compound positively over time, leading to exponential growth — if one can keep the unavoidable losses contained. Investors and traders, as human beings, have a tendency to chase performance, as it’s easy to extrapolate a previous trend. If a pattern has worked so far, why would it not continue as such for a while? Chasing performance tends to put more emphasis on capturing large moves at the expense of potentially being hit more severely, rather than trying to capture more modest moves with a focus on minimizing losses.Over the mid- to long-term, traders are better off preventing/minimizing losses than chasing performance.For illustrative purpose, let’s assume that we could systematically (i.e., with insight) capture a certain percentage of an upward move and a certain percentage of a downward move of Bitcoin (Bitcoin is here as a crypto asset example, but the same applies to traditional assets too):The capital preservation approach delivers a total return almost four times that of the performance-chasing approach (17,195% vs. 4,359%) and reduces the drawdown by 42% (-28.7% vs. -68.5%).This is a theoretical example, deliberately oversimplified for illustration purposes only.During the corrective phase, the passively held asset loses $20, whereas exposure to the same asset through an actively risk-managed strategy loses only $10.During the recovery phase, the passively held asset gains $30, whereas the same asset traded by the active strategy gains only $25.At the end of the correction/recovery cycle, the passively held asset’s price gained 10% while suffering a drawdown of 20%, whereas exposure to the same asset but backed by an actively risk-managed strategy gained 15% with only a 10% drawdown.Even if the active strategies don’t capture all of the upside moves of a passive holding, over time, they outperform greatly by minimizing the losses along the way, while the compounded interests take care of the profits.A systematic and robust risk-managed approach is the only way to make money when trading over the long term — not because you’re going to catch all of the right moves, but because you’ll cut the losses early when you are wrong, with no overthinking. Admitting error is harder than one might think for a carbon entity such as a human, but a no-brainer for silicon entities.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Data from Skew shows that the one-year realized correlation reached 0.38 on Thursday, July 9 and this came after the metric had reached new highs earlier in the week.Bitcoin - S&P 500 Realized Correlation. Source: SkewThe correlation with traditional markets has been growing at a steady pace recently, with the one-year reaching consecutive new all-time highs. Data from Skew also shows that the 1 month figure also reached its all-time high of 0.78 on Wednesday, but has since dropped to 61.5. While Bitcoin has been showing increasing correlation with the stock market, the same cannot be said for gold which has surpassed $1,800 to set a new high not seen since 2011.A recent report by Kraken’s research department found that correlation with the precious metal has been declining. Bitcoin’s 30-day rolling correlation also hit a four-month low of -0.49, a level far below its one-year average of 0.24.The correlation between Bitcoin and the traditional stock market grew following the coronavirus outbreak and the March 12 crash to $3,750. A recent Cointelegraph research report suggested that this trend could end after the halving but the exact opposite has happened. This is possibly due to the continued economic consequences of COVID-19.While a strengthening correlation between Bitcoin and equities markets is said to be a sign that the asset class is maturing, the nature of unregulated Bitcoin derivative products makes it prone to long and short squeezes. Some analysts have suggested that Bitcoin’s correlation to traditional markets may signal that BTC is becoming increasingly represented across a wider range of traditionally structured portfolios and this would be a sign that adoption continues to occur.With the halving and all the hype surrounding it long past, Bitcoin price appears to have flattened. The digital asset reached a record low volatility, with the 10-day realized volatility reaching the 0.2 mark, a low not seen since November 2018. Monthly Bitcoin volume trading into fiat or stablecoin. Source: CryptoCompareBitcoin’s decreasing volatility is also occurring alongside decreasing trading volumes and recent data shows that the volume for the BTC-USDT and BTC-USD trading pairs fell by 56% and 44% in the month of June. As the price continues to find resistance at the $9,300 level, the change of a sharp downside correction continues to increase. For this reason, traders are viewing $9,500 as the short-term level Bitcoin price needs to break. Failure to do so increases the risk that the price could drop to or below the $8,000 level. This trend can be observed across crypto derivatives and spot products. In the month of June, derivatives volumes dropped by 35.7%, the lowest figure in 2020, and spot volumes dropped by 49.3%. Dwindling volumes, low volatility, strong correlation with the equities, and a decreasing correlation to gold all seem to bring a bearish outlook to Bitcoin price, especially since other safe haven assets are performing well.

392,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading sideways for around a month now and is being outperformed by several other altcoins like Ether (ETH) and Chainlink (LINK). The cryptocurrency also hit the lowest levels of volatility since November 2018. Moreover, Bitcoin’s trading volume in it’s USDT and USD pairs has decreased by 56% and 44%, while global crypto trading volumes in June are down by 49.3% as well, according to CryptoCompare.While some point to these key factors as the start of a downtrend in Bitcoin price, there are still a few bullish scenarios to look out for. A recent report by Stack Funds found that a shift in investor demographics may soon bring the price of Bitcoin to new highs. Utilizing data from Coindance, the report found that 50% of Bitcoin investors are millennials. Given that wealth transfer between generations is happening at a faster rate, Stack Funds believes millennials’ newly-found financial freedom may lead this younger generation of investors to put heavy buy pressure on Bitcoin. The report reads:“As the millennial generation enters into the peak age of investment maturity, we believe this tech-savvy group would propel the significant shift in investors demographics, in turn, increases the propensity of bitcoin investments.”Bitcoin ownership by age group. Source: Stack FundsThe report also points to growing interest in Bitcoin and digital assets among other generations, a phenomenon which can further cement Bitcoin’s position as an investment asset class. According to a survey of Canadian citizens, ownership among baby boomers (56-76 years old) has recently tripled. Similar results were found in a recent research paper by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which found that Bitcoin ownership by people above 35 years old increased significantly. The shift in investment power to newer generations, and the growing interest in Bitcoin for older investors, could help push Bitcoin price to new heights. However, institutions will also play a significant role as they could provide the most accessible on-ramp for new retail and institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin. According to the report: “In our conservations with investors, we noted that part of this buying pressure reflects parents from gen X and baby boomers who are looking to invest long term for their children’s future.”Currently, there is no shortage of options for institutions of all sorts to get involved and the same can be said for those looking to invest their retirement in BTC.A recent survey from Morgan Stanley showed that over 80% of investors are looking to invest in a socially conscious manner, meaning, they prefer to put their money into projects that can create a positive impact on the world and society.Along with their greater aptitude for technology, millennials also display an increased concern around social issues like discrimnation, climate change, and possibly financial inclusion may soon become one their points of focus. Given the potential of cryptocurrency to address many of the issues millennials find problematic with the current financial industry, investing in Bitcoin as a new asset class ticks all the right boxes."
393,"There are over 13,000 Bitcoin (BTC) addresses that are worth at least $1 million, according to data from Glassnode.At the current prices, it takes about 107 BTC for an address to become a dollar millionaire. Since this metric is tied to the dollar price of Bitcoin, it tends to fluctuate a lot. For comparison, the number of addresses that contain at least 100 BTC has a much lower volatility.Bitcoin addresses that hold ≥ 100 BTC v. addresses that hold ≥ $1M worth of BTC. Source: Glassnode.We can observe that the number of addresses with balances of over $1 million hit a record high during the 2017 bull run, while the other metric remained largely unaffected by it. This remains one of the few indicators in the Bitcoin world with a very low variance through the years. Another possible reason is that some of these addresses are controlled by large entities like exchanges and custodians, who do not like to stray from a predetermined distribution of their Bitcoin. It should also be noted that there are over 1 million of Bitcoin which were likely mined by Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. These coins have not moved in over 10 years.So how many Bitcoin millionaires are there? The reality is that we do not know. In order for us to answer this question, we would have to know how many individuals or entities control those 13,290 addresses. This number could theoretically lie anywhere between 1 and 13,290.  Although it is possible to apply data analysis heuristics to Bitcoin addresses and transactions to narrow down this number somewhat, no such complete data set is currently available."

395,"Though Bitcoin’s (BTC) correlation with gold has diminished, the asset’s correlation with the S&P 500 stock market index is on the rise, researchers from Kraken exchange found.Kraken Intelligence, a research arm of major United States cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken, released a “Bitcoin Volatility Report” for June 2020.Published on July 9, the new report outlines a 31% drop in Bitcoin trading that resulted in a six-month low of Bitcoin’s annualized volatility, which accounted for 51% in June.According to the report, the significant decline in volumes and volatility marked June as the quietest month since February 2020 for Bitcoin. This also caused a major trend reversal that greatly impacted Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks and gold.As such, Bitcoin’s 30-day rolling correlation with gold plunged below its one-year average of 0.24 to hit a four-month low of -0.49, the researchers found. The correlation move followed a modestly positive trend in the second half of May that ended above a one-year average of 0.50, Kraken Intelligence noted.Bitcoin’s 30-day rolling correlation with gold. Source: Kraken IntelligenceWhile Bitcoin is becoming less correlated with gold, the cryptocurrency’s correlation with stock market indexes like S&P 500 is growing. According to Kraken Intelligence, the reversal trend caused Bitcoin’s correlation with S&P 500 to climb to as high as 0.65 in late June. The monthly average surged at 0.52 from a one-year average of 0.26, the analysts noted.Kraken’s data on S&P 500 correlation appears to coincide with information shared by digital asset exchange, OKCoin, earlier this week. Daniel Koehler, liquidity manager at OKCoin, told Cointelegraph that the exchange witnessed “high” levels of BTC and S&P 500 one-month realized correlation. “The last time we saw SPX and BTC 1M realized volatility spread this low was just prior to the March 12th BTC price crash,” Koehler added.Earlier in June, stock-to-flow analyst PlanB claimed that a heavy correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500 should have sent Bitcoin’s price to $18,000."

A drop late Thursday took BTC/USD back to $9,000 support. Asked whether traders should expect an exact rerun of March, however, filbfilb remained more optimistic.“I don't think there will be a dump anything like last time,” he wrote.“However; the positioning of the big players began 8.5-10.5k last time & that was before the climate took a nose bleed- these guys are short here on technicals rather than the external risk (in my opinion).”Bitcoin derivatives have sparked differing narratives in recent weeks. In late June, a $1 billion open interest expiry event initially fuelled speculation of a price drop, but ultimately had no discernable impact on the market.Other Bitcoin network fundamentals remain strong, with hash rate reaching all-time average highs this week and difficulty set for a 9% upward adjustment in two days’ time."
397,"Kazakhstan is becoming an important destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners seeking cheap electricity in the post-halving market driven by thinner margins. According to recent reports, the oil-rich Central Asian country expects the total amount of money invested in local crypto mining operations to double by the end of 2020 and attract $738 million over the next three years.Unlike other countries in Central Asia, the Kazakh government has de facto legalized crypto mining, which makes the market more attractive for both local and foreign players. So, could this vast semidesert land become the new go-to spot for BTC miners?The Kazakh government has adopted an overall friendly approach to crypto recently, although there is still little regulatory clarity on the subject. However, positive developments were preceded by regulatory turbulence, and at some point, its central bank went as far as to suggest a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies.In early 2018, the chairman of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, Daniyar Akishev, declared that his agency was considering outlawing all cryptocurrencies. Just a few months later, Kazakhstan’s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, called for global cooperation in crypto regulation but did not mention whether this regulation should encourage the sector’s growth or its containment.Previously in 2017, Kazakhstan’s government-supported Astana International Finance Center signed a deal with Malta-based firm Exante to develop the Kazakh digital asset market, while the central bank announced it was considering using blockchain to sell short-term debt notes to investors.Things started to look more concrete and positive for local crypto miners in 2019. In December of last year, local media reported that Kazakhstan’s lawmakers wouldn’t be taxing cryptocurrency mining until the mined assets are exchanged for fiat money, as crypto mining would not be treated as an entrepreneurial activity but rather a “purely technological process.” A recent bill, which was approved by the Kazakh Senate and signed into law by Nazarbayev earlier in June, essentially legalizes mining, saying that people involved in digital mining are obliged to inform the authorities about their activities. It also stresses that miners are the legal owners of the digital assets they produce.Didar Bekbauov, founder of crypto mining marketplace Xive — a local company providing hosting services for large-scale international miners — and who previously worked at Hive Mining, told Cointelegraph that the current regulation is not strict, but stressed that the framework hasn’t been finalized yet: “The bill says miners need to report to [the] government about their activities. But nobody still knows how it will be in practice. Other than that no regulations.”According to Bekbauov, the main mining players in Kazakhstan are foreign companies from China, Japan and “other Asian countries.” There is also Genesis Mining, an international cloud mining company with farms located across several countries, and Bitfury, another non-Chinese mining powerhouse headquartered in Amsterdam.“They are miners with experience, some private funds, private investors,” Bekbauov said of the companies mining away in Kazakhstan. The Xive founder added that around 90% of their mining activities are performed on the Bitcoin blockchain, and he said that the arrival of foreign companies doesn’t make it harder for local mom-and-pop mining operations, as Kazakhstan “still has excess electricity generation.”Therefore, the main attraction for miners is not the regulatory framework, which still remains ambiguous despite some positive developments, but rather the abnormally cheap electricity rates. As of December 2019, the price of electricity in Kazakhstan was $0.041 per kilowatt-hour for households and $0.049 for businesses. For comparison, the average electricity price in the United States is $0.14, although some states such as Texas seem to be offering competitive prices under certain conditions.The price of electricity has always been one of the main factors when it comes to cryptocurrency mining, but it has become even more important after the Bitcoin halving took place back in May. The halved reward prompted miners to either sell their equipment or relocate to regions with cheaper electricity such as Kazakhstan, Russia, the Middle East and South America.Along with the abundance of cheap electricity, Kazakhstan’s geographical position also makes it “a fast-growing hotbed for Bitcoin mining action,” according to Thomas Heller, global business director of F2Pool, who also told Cointelegraph:“Kazakhstan is located in an optimal location for mining. The climate is cool, and is in close proximity to China. It’s becoming a popular location for Chinese miners to move old-gen machines from China to Kazakhstan to take advantage of cheaper electricity prices outside of the Sichuan Hydro Season.”Bekbauov said that most local mining operations are located in regions with high electricity generation — such as Ekibastuz, Karagandy, Pavlodar and Taraz — while the country has an overall good climate for crypto mining throughout most of the year. Dmitrii Ushakov, chief commercial officer of BitRiver — a major co-location services provider for Bitcoin mining in the Commonwealth of Independent States region — confirmed that the cheap electricity prices in Kazakhstan are luring investors in, telling Cointelegraph: “Miners can currently find very attractive electricity prices for mining in Kazakhstan and some other former Soviet countries. This is the main reason for the current interest in mining in Kazakhstan.”However, Ushakov added that there are “no natural prerequisites for cheap electricity in the country,” as it is mainly produced by coal-fired power plants. He elaborated, expanding on some other drawbacks of Kazakhstan-based mining, namely an overall unstable situation in the region and inadequate safety of local mining farms:“This is risky because the markets and other factors affecting the price of such electricity within a nation can change quickly. Another aspect that should be considered here is the safety of these mining sites, which are often set up in a very short time by using pre-existing infrastructure that is old and unreliable.”Last month, Kazakhstan’s minister of digital development, innovation and aerospace industry, Askar Zhumagaliyev, announced that the department is planning to attract 300 billion tenge, or $738 million, worth of investments by 2023 for activities related to cryptocurrency mining.Kazakhstan’s ambitious mining plans might seem staggering at first, but the country has some statistics to back them up. According to Zhumagaliyev, there are currently 14 cryptocurrency mining farms that have already brought in approximately $201.7 million of investments combined.Further, the Bitcoin Mining Map designed by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance at the Judge Business School of the University of Cambridge shows that the countries in the CIS region combined comprise the fourth largest region for crypto mining globally. In the second quarter of 2020, mining in Kazakhstan has reportedly made up about 6.17% of the average monthly Bitcoin hash rate, which is only slightly behind Russia (6.9%) and the United States (7.24%), while China remains the undisputed king (over 65%). Alejandro De La Torre, vice president of mining pool Poolin, agreed that under certain conditions, Kazakhstan could become third in the near future:“With the abundance of cheap electrical prices, mild temperatures and the governments ’hands-off’ approach to mining, I do indeed foresee Kazakhstan becoming a top-3 crypto mining destination.”Other experts are more skeptical. BitRiver’s Ushakov argued that although low electricity prices are a solid advantage for Kazakhstan in the mining race, the region itself isn’t stable enough to witness significant growth:“Although low electricity prices make Kazakhstan a hot destination to mine, we believe that China, Russia and the USA will continue to be the top-3 mining destinations in the world because of increasing investments in mining, predictable energy policies and a more stable political as well as economic environment for mining.”Kristy-Leigh Minehan, a mining consultant and former chief technology officer of Core Scientific, told Cointelegraph that she does not expect Kazakhstan to become a top-three destination anytime soon due to an apparent lack of interest from institutional players: “Bitcoin mining is becoming the destination of institutional investment that seeks an alternate asset base; many are still very shy with regards to Kazakhstan’s politics.”"
398,"One of four men charged with defrauding investors of more than $722 million through a long-running cryptocurrency mining scheme has pleaded guilty to charges against him.The man, a 35-year-old Romanian programmer called Silviu Catalin Bacali, was arrested in Germany in December 2019. He was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud as well as a conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities. He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.Three others — Matthew Brent Goettsche, Russ Albert Medlin, Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks and Joseph Frank Abel — were charged in connection with the scheme in the United States that same month.Prosecutors allege that the scheme — operational between April 2014 and December 2019 — solicited money from investors in exchange for shares in purported cryptocurrency mining pools. Investors were awarded bonuses for recruiting further investors into the network. The indictment cites correspondence between Goettsche and Balaci, in which they allegedly discussed how to fake mining earnings and referred to their investors as “sheep.”  While the other defendants allegedly offered investors the choice of investing in three separate Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools, Bacali admitted that he himself was unaware that the BitClub Network operated more than one pool.Further correspondence between the programmer and Goettsche from 2015 apparently revealed that Bacali was asked to “bump up the daily mining earnings starting today by 60%,” which he objected to as being “not sustainable” and “ponzi teritori.”He is nonetheless charged with changing figures to mislead investors at his accomplice’s urging. Bacali has also confirmed prosecutors’ allegation that the scheme fleeced at least $722 million worth of BTC from investors.In March 2017, Cointelegraph reported on allegations that BitClub had launched a malleability attack on the Bitcoin network. The scheme had also been flagged as suspicious by crypto media news outlet 99Bitcoins as early as 2016."
399,"The wholesale embrace of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) mining for Bitcoin (BTC) could increase the cost of a 51% attack by a factor of up to 2,000.Rod Garratt University of California Santa Barbara presented the research he co-authored with Maarten van Oordt from the Bank of Canada at the Unitize conference on July 10.It examined the varying costs of a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network based on the type of equipment used to secure the network. The research suggests by simply switching the network 100% ASIC miners ongoing security can be enhanced greatly. The main reason is because ASIC miners have little use, and little value, outside of Bitcoin mining and an attacker would not be able to obtain much of a return from the sale of equipment used in an attack. Consequently, in order to perform a profitable attack, they would need to double spend a much higher volume of coins, which is more costly and difficult to do.The research estimated that for an attack occurring after the next halving to be profitable, it would require between 157,000 - 530,000 Bitcoin if 100% ASIC mining was in place. A 51% attack is when a malicious participant seeks to manipulate a blockchain network by controlling 51% of the mining power (this is the minimum needed to accept new blocks). The attacker then creates an alternate chain of blocks to the ‘real’ chain, and transitions the rest of the network to accept the new, manipulated chain as the correct one.The most common use-case for this style of attack is to spend the same coins twice, commonly referred to as a double spend.Some in the Bitcoin community are adverse to ASIC miners, which caused a hard fork in 2017 that resulted in ASIC-resistant Bitcoin Gold being created. Garratt said this was why Bitcoin Gold had a number of successful 51% attacks resulting in the double-spend of $18 million in coins, while Bitcoin is yet to receive its first successful attack. However, it is vastly more expensive to attack Bitcoin, which is also a big factor.Some Bitcoin network participants are concerned over the long term security of the blockchain network as block rewards are replaced with transaction fees, he explained, which leaves miners relying on transaction fees as their rewards. The potential danger is that once miners are relying on transaction fees, they will react to large price fluctuations by turning off their miners, making it more cost effective to perform an attack on the network.Garratt mentions another security benefit from using ASIC machines is that miners are much less likely to switch off their equipment as a result of price fluctuations, increasing the strength of the network against price fluctuations."
400,"The Chinese authorities dismantled a significant crypto-related scam in Wenzhou. The scheme amassed over 100 million yuan ($14.31 million), which was seized along with a number of luxury cars and villas.According to Toutiao, the gang has been operating since 2019 and primarily sought out victims through Telegram chat groups, including one called “Huobi Global Moving Brick Arbitrage HT Chinese Group Community.”The report states the scammers pretended to be investors who had benefited from an “investment scheme.”The scammers told their victims that all they had to do was send their cryptos to a fake Huobi wallet address, and the “investor” would receive a more substantial amount in Huobi Token (HT) in return. Instead, they received a fake HT link.Mo Li, the head of marketing at HashKey Hub, said through a tweet that Chinese police had seized “tens of thousands” of Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Tether (USDT).The scammers told their victims that the scheme would guarantee 8% in returns.Local media outlets commented that the group was known to frequent bars and nightclubs, where they would spend their stolen money. The allegedly rented presidential suites in hotels when they traveled across China, and even rented out large office buildings to establish a headquarters for their illegal endeavors.According to the local police, over 1,300 people reported being scammed by the scheme, as the investigation is still ongoing.Chinese authorities also dismantled a group of alleged scammers on May 21, posing as Huobi exchange officials, who were operating an over-the-counter (OTC) website.The police arrested 12 suspects in Guangdong province believed to be behind the scheme, after an investigation found that WeChat crypto trading groups had been infiltrated from November 2019."

403,"Michael Novogratz, one of the biggest Bitcoin (BTC) bulls in the world, does not recommend investors to put the majority of their funds into Bitcoin.Although Novogratz is confident that Bitcoin “way outperforms” the precious metal, it is still safer to buy more gold than Bitcoin due to the cryptocurrency’s highly volatile nature.“My sense is that Bitcoin way outperforms gold, but I would tell people to have a lot less Bitcoin than they have gold, just because of the volatility,” Novogratz said during CNBC’s Fast Money on July 8.According to Novogratz, Bitcoin is still “early in the adoption cycle,” which means that the cryptocurrency is still hard to obtain. However, the major digital currency will be gradually gaining momentum as more companies around the world are introducing more tools to bring the mass adoption to crypto.Novogratz said:“Bitcoin is still hard to buy. If it was easier to buy, it would be a lot higher. And there are more and more people making it easier to buy: funds being set up, custodies being done, at one point we’ll get an ETF.”Novogratz’s call to prioritize gold over Bitcoin comes amid gold prices hitting a nine-year high. On July 9, gold broke a $1,800 threshold, reaching the highest price since September 2011. The soaring gold prices are apparently a result of economic fears over the novel coronavirus. As of press time, spot gold trades at $1,810, up about 0.1% over the past 24 hours.Novogratz is known as one of the biggest crypto and blockchain investors. He runs Galaxy Digital, a major crypto venture capital firm and trading desk. Alongside investing in the emerging industry, Novogratz is bullish on BTC price, predicting Bitcoin to hit $20,000 by the end of 2020.Last year, Novogratz predicted that institutional interest would push the Bitcoin price back to $20,000 before the end of 2019. The cryptocurrency failed to meet these expectations, eventually trading around $7,000 at year’s end."
404,"Blockstream’s Liquid Network is now featuring its own Javascript library for developers to easily interact with the blockchain.Named LiquidJS, it was developed and announced by pTokens, an interoperability project working to bring assets cross-chain. The open-source library simplifies access to the Liquid Network for external applications, with no requirements of setting up dedicated nodes.Thomas Bertani, pTokens’ founder, described it as the equivalent of Ethereum’s web3.js library in a conversation with Cointelegraph. Javascript is currently among the most popular programming languages used by virtually all web applications in some form. As such, Javascript libraries for interfacing with blockchains are used “by several thousands of projects,” Bertani said.He explained that the Liquid library enables a wide range of uses, including easy integration with wallets. Currently very few providers support Liquid, and Blockstream Green is the only software wallet available to average users. But the library’s capabilities go beyond that:“It can also be used with DApps - financial tools, swaps, private transactions etc. For example, this library will enable interoperability projects like pTokens to add support for Liquid Network.”In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Blockstream marketing director Neil Woodfine said that “based on the popularity of BitcoinJS over the last few years, LiquidJS should further accelerate the deployment of Liquid applications.”He also explained that Blockstream’s focus right now is on “core technology that strengthens the foundations of the Liquid Network,” mentioning an upcoming upgrade to a dynamic validator federation.The Liquid Network is commonly referred to as a sidechain of Bitcoin (BTC), as it uses a bridged version of Bitcoin as its native currency. While its primary purpose is to enable quick BTC transfers between exchanges, its assets feature is being used by a game developer to create non-fungible tokens.Liquid is in many ways an upgraded version of Bitcoin as it is built on its code base. It features faster block times and transaction finality, confidential transactions for privacy, and native support for custom tokens. In addition, a much more advanced scripting language is scheduled for release this year.Bertani said that the creation of the library was motivated by pTokens’ wish to “contribute to the ecosystem beyond our own solution alone.” But he also revealed that the team will make use of the library to bring currencies from other chains to Liquid.The project is currently providing several wrapped tokens on both Ethereum (ETH) and EOS, allowing DeFi project Equilibrium to support BTC collateral.Woodfine said that the company is welcoming support for additional blockchains:“There are already a few wrapped tokens starting to emerge on the network. We’re expecting pTokens work to accelerate this trend and introduce some interesting trust-minimized models for importing existing assets to the Liquid Network.”He suggested that the primary use case for these additional tokens would be for trading on exchanges, similar to how it works for BTC.Nevertheless, the library’s potential seems to go beyond simply transferring tokens. While Liquid is positioned as a settlement layer, many of its features support use cases similar to smart contract platforms. However, some criticize Liquid’s approach given the network’s high degree of centralization."

You did not have to pay the entire cost of the shoes because you had some digital store credit that you had earned by blogging about the business. Now, you own a physical pair of shoes, but the store has also given you a digital token representing your shoes.It is your lucky day. The digital shoes you just received are ultra-rare. They have platinum laces and are diamond-studded. You just hit a digital lottery! You race home and turn on your game console. You send the digital shoes from your wallet to your game. You find the digital card representing your favorite basketball star, and you equip them with the digital shoes. Boom! Powerup unlocked, and now your sports star runs faster, and the chance of spraining their ankle in the game has reduced.You play games with your friends, and your powerhouse star helps you to trounce your buddy in Japan. The game sends you some cryptocurrency as a celebratory gift. You post your satisfying victory on social media and earn praise and more crypto for having smashed your friend so brutally.Welcome to web 3.0.We’re not there yet. We’re still building the necessary infrastructure, and web 3.0 is worth the wait.Let’s roll back the clock and talk about now. We walk into a store and buy an item. The cashier hands us a receipt after we pay in cash or card. Or, when we work with a real estate agent and purchase a house, we get a deed. Even if you have to register your motorcycle at the Department of Motor Vehicles, you will be asked to present a vehicle identification number. All of these actions require some form of deed or receipt to track ownership. Nearly all of this is done on paper, but there is a better way to do this tracking by using an open-source and public database that is also known as a blockchain.If you’ve been living outside the fintech space, you may not have heard of blockchain technology or cryptocurrency. In short, a blockchain is a public and open-source database that stores data over time in chunks (blocks) as it grows.Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Litecoin (LTC) utilize blockchain technology as a stable platform to transact and store the data of transactions. You can download a wallet in order to earn or buy cryptocurrency and send it around the world with near zero barriers. It’s hardcoded economic freedom.Modern databases are powerful machines capable of doing millions of transactions per second. They can be used for more than just transferring numbers around among users. So, yes, you can send BTC to your sister for her birthday, but there’s more to it.If I say I’ll give you a dollar, you wouldn’t typically ask me, “Which one?” It doesn’t matter. Any dollar bill with George Washington on it out of my wallet will likely suffice for you to buy something at 7/11. Similarly, if I tell you, “I’ll send you a Bitcoin so you can buy a motorcycle,” you’re not going to ask me, “Which Bitcoin?” While each Bitcoin can, in reality, be tracked separately, the market treats all of them as entirely equivalent, and the buzzword for that is “fungible.”Imagine it’s our wedding day, and I tell you that I’ve bought you a house. Before getting all excited, you may want to ask, “Which one did you buy?” That’s because all houses aren’t exact replicas of one another. They’re different. And even model homes using the same plans are different because of their construction. Houses are unique; their mortgages are unique, and these are tracked separately with lots of painstaking detail.Houses, receipts, trading cards and many other things in this world are nonfungible. They are unique; they can’t be substituted even with something that has the same name or shape — for example, an autographed football card or a house whose roof has caved in. There are differences in everything that exists.On a blockchain, there are generally two types of tokens that can be tracked. Fungible tokens are like currencies that don’t have unique properties, and all we care about is quantity and ownership. Nonfungible tokens, however, differ in that we can track things in detail for property rights, time of purchase, evidence of the transaction, edition, rarity, statistics and millions of other possible categories that make something unique.NFTs can serve as a digital deed or receipt and then it can have utility. The next time you buy a pack of trading cards, you can pay with crypto and receive NFTs in return.These tokens can also represent property rights. Imagine that you buy clipart. You can download the images, but if you want to use them commercially, you have to own the token that transfers the rights. If a company sees its image being used, the NFT in your possession indicates that you have purchased the right to use those images.These tokens can also be used to track individual inventory. You could receive an NFT when you buy a brand new car or a house. The keys to your wallet and the presence of the NFT proves that you are the rightful owner. More importantly, others can use the public database to check if you are the rightful owner. There is no more need to worry about whether something is counterfeit or not. You either have the keys and NFT in your wallet, or you don’t; and anyone with an internet connection can check.Crypto is a brutal space. One minute, token prices are falling, and the question you ask yourself is: “Can I survive this?” The next minute, prices are climbing, and the question now is: “Can I scale rapidly?” The market is savage. That’s leading to a lot of boom and bust in the market, it’s also creating hardened and sustainable companies. It’s hard to be wasteful on a blockchain as the market chews them up.The nascent industry is still experiencing growing pains, but distributed blockchains have been developing, and businesses have been increasingly setting themselves up on blockchains. Once they’re established on a blockchain, businesses will be able to track transactions in detail with unique tokens, and those tokens will be transferable across vast interconnected networks.You’ll get your collectible sports stars, buy digital rights to your favorite piece of art, send your kid crypto on their birthday, and watch as commerce is reshaped by blockchain technology and NFTs.

406,"Bitcoin (BTC) can crash hard, but not so hard that it ends up costing $0 — because one man is going to buy all of it.In tweets on July 9, entrepreneur and outspoken Bitcoin bull Alistair Milne revealed that he had placed an order for 18.52 million BTC ($174 billion) — more than the current supply — on exchange Bitfinex.In what appears to be more a tongue-in-cheek gesture than concern that Bitcoin is in for a major fall, Milne uploaded a screenshot of the Bitfinex orderbook.“I hereby confirm that #Bitcoin will never go to zero (at least on @bitfinex),” he wrote. “I'm buying them all at $0.01.”In order to complete the purchase, Milne will need the princely sum of $185,200 — currently equal to 19.7 BTC if he chooses to set aside a portion of his holdings for such an eventuality.Bitfinex orderbook showing Alistair Milne’s buy order for 18.52 million BTC.

After his words, RT host Max Keiser claimed that both he and Schiff would ultimately buy up huge amounts of BTC once it hits $50,000."
407,"Recent investments into cryptocurrency mining equipment by smaller players could be a positive signal for the longevity and value of Bitcoin (BTC). In late June, United States-based blockchain firm Core Scientific ordered over 17,000 of the latest Bitcoin mining ASIC machines from Chinese hardware producer Bitmain. The news made waves in the industry as the largest known order of Antminer S19s by a single operator.Core Scientific will use some of the machines for its own operations while the rest will be used for its cloud-based mining services for clients. Furthermore, one of its major clients, Horizon Kinetics, has increased its investment with Core Scientific in order to access the new mining equipment from Bitmain.The news is the latest in a string of investments and developments of major mining operations outside of China, which has long been considered the hub of the global Bitcoin mining ecosystem for over half a decade. Major investments by smaller firms looking to increase their footprints in the mining space not only create positive sentiment for the industry but also show that smaller players are actively looking to get involved in a space that has been dominated by bigger companies.Investments into cryptocurrency mining equipment by smaller industry participants suggest that there is growing confidence in the sector. Despite the fact that the Bitcoin mining reward went through its most recent halving event, operators seem to be playing the long game, indicating an optimistic outlook for the industry.Cointelegraph spoke to Jason Deane, an analyst for financial analysis and advisory firm Quantum Economics, who has hands-on experience in the mining industry. The investment into miners made by Core Scientific illustrates the optimism in the sector, according to Deane. “They clearly feel this, or they wouldn’t do it,” he said. Additionally, Deane believes the equation is quite simple when one looks at the numbers:“Mining is a business that is absolute in the key numbers, so it’s simply a question of assessing profitability on an ongoing basis. While difficulty and hashrate are variable and closely related, we can assume that both will increase over time. If the Bitcoin price rises significantly, we can also be quite confident that they will rise much faster. It all comes down to cost and protecting position — if you can secure power that ensures your breakeven is very low, say $6,000 or less per Bitcoin, then you have good insurance against whatever comes next.”It is also important to consider the price of the latest mining equipment to understand the implications of major investments in a large-scale operation. A new Antminer S19 retails for $1,785 on Bitmain’s website. If Core Scientific bought its miners at that price, that figure alone would be around $30 million for 17,000 units.Nevertheless, Deane is not surprised by the value of investments into the newest mining hardware, even after the latest halving, and suggested that some miners could operate profitably up until the next halving, which is due to take place in 2024: “The feeling going forward is broadly bullish and there are no more adjustments for four years,” adding that the “current equipment, purchased so early in this halving cycle, has a good chance of getting a good ROI and may even be good for the whole period.”Johnson Xu, head of research and chief analyst at TokenInsight, told Cointelegraph that a number of firms with access to capital had been preparing to invest in mining equipment before the halving. The move was spurred by the opportunity to increase operational efficiency by selling older equipment for new machines:“I think the Antminer S19 deliveries happening straight post-halving is another contributing factor towards recent massive investments into mining equipment. The S19, among others, is one of the latest SHA-256 mining ASICs on the market, thus plenty of buyers are willing to acquire the latest generation machines in order to upgrade their existing operations or purely for the purpose of opening a new mining farm.”In an opinion piece previously published by Cointelegraph, Xu examined the hash rate decline of Bitcoin following the halving event and suggested that it could have positive effects on the ecosystem. He backed up those sentiments in his latest correspondence, highlighting the prime opportunity for those miners who haven’t done so yet to upgrade hardware, adding: “For those miners who cannot lower their electricity expenses, upgrading to the most efficient miners is the best strategy for longer-term profitability.”Simon Peters, a market analyst for eToro, also gave some insight into the recent surge of investments in mining hardware in the shadow of Bitcoin’s halving in May. Peters believes that the current situation of the market further incentivizes operators to become efficient and plan ahead:“There is even greater incentive for miners to become more efficient. Miners must find ways to decrease overheads and stay profitable, even if it means investing greater capital at this moment to become more efficient in the future.”The lead up to Bitcoin’s latest reward halving was awash with wide-ranging predictions on the impact it would have on the price of the preeminent cryptocurrency as well as its effects on the mining ecosystem.There was an immediate impact on the Bitcoin mining difficulty in the days after the halving event, but the overall sentiment was that the halving did not have an overly negative effect on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Any major investment into a particular industry or business is bound to instill positive sentiment for the future, and Deane believes it illustrates a changing sentiment toward Bitcoin:“I’d consider it a positive endorsement of the industry as a whole and a demonstration of the belief in the longevity of Bitcoin itself. We’re leaving the days of Bitcoin being experimental or ’only for geeks’ behind and moving into a new era of professionalism and application. It makes perfect sense that this level of investment is happening now.”That sentiment, according to Xu, is evident in the strong inflow of capital into the mining sector due to the perception of Bitcoin mining being a major component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem: “Although the mining ecosystem can still be considered as opaque, lacking sufficient data and information, we have seen many industry participants working together to bring transparency to the sector.”Peters also argued that these recent events could also strengthen the Bitcoin mining ecosystem by making it more efficient, as “only the strongest and most efficient mining operations will survive,” but he also provided a potential downside in that regard: “On the flip side, there is now a greater fear around centralisation of hashpower and that too much of the network’s hashrate is being controlled by only a few mining pools.”Peters raised another interesting byproduct of investment by smaller operations: mining power moving away from China. The country has long been the geographical home to miners accountable for a large portion of the Bitcoin hash rate. Peters offered three potential reasons for this:“Greater appetite from venture capitalists to invest in crypto from these countries; more favourable conditions to run a mining operation both in terms of cooler climates and access to renewable energy; and lastly, existing mining operations from China expanding into other countries to hedge their risks.”"
408,"The Texas State Securities Board has shut down the activities of a South African multi-level marketing scheme involving cryptocurrency investments in the state.In a recent statement, Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles said that the company has duped investors into sending them Bitcoin (BTC), which would supposedly be transferred to unidentified forex brokers for automated trading using artificial intelligence.According to the statement, Mirror Trading International PTY LTD recruited unregistered salespersons to lure investors to invest money for a return of 10% per month. The salespersons were supposed to promote the scheme and onboard new investors and multilevel marketers to earn their commissions.Apart from promoting the get-rich-quick scheme through an MLM program, regulators also accused the company and its operator Cornelius Johannes “Johan” Steynberg of misrepresenting or concealing important information regarding the background of the owner, the forex broker, the handling of its cryptocurrencies, and the artificial intelligence used for trading.Mirror Trading reportedly exaggerated their accomplishments and claimed that they had enrolled almost 76,000 members from across 170 countries, of which, 22,500 had signed up in the last four months.Iles named ForexAndBitcoin.com, Michael Cullison, Steve Herceg, and Brian Knott as the four multilevel marketers involved with this scheme. He said that their actions were illegal according to laws that require the registration of securities and their sellers.The agency’s director of enforcement Joe Rotunda said that this could just be the tip of the iceberg:“Fraudulent multilevel marketing get-rich-quick schemes gain momentum and spread like wildfire through the internet. We brought this action to quickly stop the illegal scheme before it irreparably harms Texans.”"

410,"BitFlyer, the biggest crypto exchange in Japan in terms of trading volume, has announced a partnership with Brave, the privacy-protecting browser. According to the announcement, BitFlyer and Brave will develop “a crypto asset wallet for Brave browser users”. No further details about the new crypto wallet have been made available. Japanese users of Brave browser are rewarded with Basic Attention Token Points (BAP), due to regulations that prevent them from earning the cryptocurrency BAT, or trading their points for money on exchanges.The announcement is likely to fuel speculation that the new crypto wallet could pave the way to enable Japanese users to earn BAT, instead of BAP, or somehow convert between the two.A Brave spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“At this point, we are using ‘points’ to reward users but there are some limits. [Through the partnership] we think it may be possible to go beyond that” BitFlyer explained that further details about the crypto wallet will be revealed at an event held on July 30th in Tokyo in which Brendan Eich the founder of Brave will participate. The event is mainly targeting advertisers. Brave is becoming increasingly popular in Japan. Last month, Brave partnered with Korean pop idol group “BTS”   — AKA the Bangtan Boys — and Rush Gaming, a Japanese esports team to develop browsers exclusively for users in Japan. In the case of Rush Gaming, users of the limited edition browser can earn BAP by watching ads. The BAP can be used to support Rush Gaming’s esports team.Recently, several Japanese crypto exchanges including BitFlyer announced trading of Brave’s native token BAT. While refraining from saying what users can do with the new wallet, BitFlyer said:“Brave is the BAT connected browser and browsing is an everyday activity. It will be a new opportunity for users to use and earn cryptocurrency and we see it as a new model case to show the potential of cryptocurrency [...] We want to make people feel more familiar with cryptocurrency through the partnership with Brave”BitFlyer and Brave are also planning to launch a joint marketing campaign in Japan “to expand the recognition of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology among our customers and to improve customer convenience”."
411,"Australian comedian Jim Jefferies has amassed a larger stack of Bitcoin than billionaire Elon Musk.In a June 30 episode of Jefferies’ podcast I Don’t Know About That, the comedian revealed to “Invest Diva” Kiana Danial that he was slightly more informed about cryptocurrency than his comedy team apparently knew — his podcast staff typically select topics the comedian has little or no knowledge of.“I have one Bitcoin,” Jefferies said, “I bought it as a bit of a laugh just on the Robinhood app just to see what this crypto is all about.” The comedian said he currently owns $9,612 “worth of a Bitcoin” but Danial determined Jefferies hadn’t yet transferred his token to a wallet — and of course, “not your keys, not your Bitcoin.”The purchase of 1 BTC makes him richer in Bitcoin terms than tech billionaire Elon Musk, who confirmed in May that his Bitcoin holdings were still at a measly 0.25 BTC — $2,347 at the time of writing.Jefferies’ net worth is estimated close to $9 million, meaning his crypto investment makes up just 0.1% of his assets — a little less than billionaire Paul Tudor Jones’ 1%.As the podcast is intended to be both educational and entertaining, Jefferies listened to Danial explain some basic crypto terms and history. When the subject of Satoshi Nakamoto came up, the comedian quickly responded:“Everyone knows who he is — two Michelin stars, best tuna in town.”Cold storage was another comedic detour:“I’m going to buy some Bitcoins, and I’m gonna put my wallet in the fridge.”Comments on Jefferies’ knowledge were mixed, but many members of Crypto Twitter were critical of Danial’s explanation of blockchain and cryptocurrency. “That’s what you need: someone who doesn’t understand a subject to a bunch of people who have never heard of it,” said Twitter user Westy447, “Like a cat trying to explain cycling to fish.”Podcaster Marty Bent even offered to be a replacement for Danial after another user brought her performance to his attention: “The so-called expert they had on was a total disaster. I would love Jim Jefferies to come on your show, so he can learn about Bitcoin the right way.”Jefferies is the second major comedian to express an interest in cryptocurrency over a podcast in a week. Cointelegraph reported on July 2 that Anthony Pompliano had successfully convinced comedian Bill Burr to invest in Bitcoin."
412,"Speaking at Unitize virtual event, Coin Metrics researcher Lucas Nuzzi suggested that one way for exchanges to fight back against the hackers is by renting mining power from online marketplaces.Nuzzi conjectured that an exchange which has been hacked could rent enough hashing power through an online marketplace to force a favorable network reorganization:“So, it is essentially a technique to try and reorg yourself by renting mining power and doing that work where if you’re an exchange and you've been hacked, within those six work confirmations that the network is expecting to be considered final. [...] But through mining, you could potentially, within those six blocks, alter a transaction where your hot wallet has been drained. So, that's one of the approaches through mining.”Nuzzi alluded to the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) transactions are not necessarily final prior to confirmation. It is generally assumed that they become final after six block confirmations, which typically take an hour. Thus, an exchange, either by renting the majority of hashpower or in coalition with mining pools could choose to accept a version of the chain where the hack did not happen. This scenario may sound unrealistic to most, at least, when it comes to Bitcoin. However, it was something that Binance (BNB) CEO Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, was seriously considering after an infamous Binance hack, which cost the exchange 7,000 BTC. Later, under the heavy criticism from the crypto community, CZ reconsidered the plan.Nuzzi confirmed to Cointelegraph that this solution is impractical for bigger coins like Bitcoin, but could be used for smaller ones:“It'd actually be impossible for exchanges, or any entity really, to reorg BTC via NiceHash. This could, however, be an effective counterattack on smaller chains with more niche hashing algos, like Lyra or Equihash.”Nuzzi also pointed to the attack on Bitcoin Gold (BTG), where the community was able to repel the attacker to support his theory."

The group has incentivized people to place Bitcoin-related stickers in cities around the world.According to the initiative’s official website, named “Bitcoin Awareness Game,” the campaign seeks to change the public perception that Bitcoin is related to criminals and scams.The stickers — which contain messages such as “fix the money,” “fix the world,” “B the change,” “can’t tread on me,” “exit fiat,” “Inflation,” among others — began appearing in the streets of Munich at the beginning of June 2020. Now, they are being spread across the planet.To facilitate a wider spread for their pro-Bitcoin message, the collective published printable, open license PDFs that allow anyone to download and create their own stickers.Recently, people began publishing photos of the stickers on the streets of other European countries such as the United Kingdom, Austria, and even Asian countries like Pakistan.Bounty No. 10 paid out, featuring a locally famous cat called Dora and the DIY 'freedom money' #bitcoin sticker https://t.co/ed4ADg6taCThe collective launched a crowdfunding campaign to incentivize others to disseminate the campaign’s stickers — bought through the Ideas Are Like Flames shop — to public places around the globe.

415,"Deutsche Bank was recently ordered to pay a $150 million fine for “significant compliance failures” in its relationship with alleged child sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein. The Bitcoin community on Reddit is highlighting this latest case of misconduct from major financial institutions.According to CNBC reporting on Tuesday, New York state financial regulators issued a $150 million penalty to the bank for offering banking services to Epstein despite being aware of his previous indictments.In the consent order under which Deutsche agreed to pay reparations, regulators show that the bank’s executives were aware of a memorandum that detailed Epstein’s long history of sex crime allegations and convictions in Florida. Epstein was charged with soliciting an underage prostitute in 2007, serving 13 months in an abnormally lenient prison sentence.The bank’s relationship manager focused instead on how lucrative the relationship could be, projecting a “revenue of $2-4 million annually over time” in an email with top executives. The manager also suggested that accounts should be opened for entities affiliated with Epstein, not for physical persons.The regulators also chastised the bank for oversight failures as the banking relationship continued. Transactions processed by the bank include transfers to publicly alleged co-conspirators, in addition to “periodic suspicious cash withdrawals” totaling $800,000 over four years.Epstein was friends with both president Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, fueling a popular conspiracy theory that questions the legitimacy of his supposed suicide in a jail cell.The Bitcoin community often brings up cases of fraud and corruption in major financial institutions, given recurring categorizations of Bitcoin as an enabler of crime and money laundering by some Wall Street executives.In May 2020, a Goldman Sachs investor report argued that Bitcoin is not an investable asset, citing criminal usage.However, major banks often facilitate money laundering and terrorism financing. The community pointed to several high profile accusations and convictions, like HSBC’s alleged laundering of Mexican drug money proceeds.A 2018 report found that the majority of European banks were fined for money laundering charges in the past decade.JPMorgan was found guilty of money laundering in several major scandals.One commentator nevertheless noted that regulators took issue with Deutsche’s lack of intrusive action into Epstein’s banking. Authorities may have similar concerns with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, where these intrusions are impossible by design.But despite crypto’s lack of oversight, blockchain analysis consistently finds that only a minuscule part of its throughput is criminal in nature."
416,"Altcoins have been buzzing around this week and this has reduced Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance to 63%. Pantera Capital founder Dan Morehead believes that altcoins are going to outperform Bitcoin, the top-ranked asset on CoinMarketCap, over the next couple of years. This does not mean that Morehead is negative on Bitcoin price because he clarified that the firm expects Bitcoin to “to go up a ton, but altcoins will go up even more.”However, investors should be careful about what they invest because pump and dump schemes and liquidity issues continue to plague many altcoins. Take for example, the recent TikTok challenge which saw Dogecoin (DOGE) price pump by more than 60% in 24-hours.Such challenges, when not backed by strong fundamentals, might end in disaster for several investors.

417,"As the global economic engine continues to reel from the effects of the slowdown induced by the novel coronavirus, it’s still not clear how much devastation the pandemic has actually caused. For example, due to the restrictions imposed by governments all over the world, such as border lockdowns, trade limitations and import/export reductions, economic movement has almost ceased, causing many businesses, both large and small, to either face up to the losses or shut down completely.Furthermore, traditional financial offerings such as stocks, bonds and equities have also been on the receiving end of a beating since mid-February, with many well-respected economists warning that the global economy is once again heading in the direction of a major recession — the effects of which will most likely be more profound than any of the other slowdowns witnessed in the past.To put things into perspective, the FTSE 100, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nikkei 225 have all witnessed value drops of unprecedented proportions over the past four months. In fact, the Dow and the FTSE saw their biggest quarterly falls in more than three decades during the start of the year.As a result of these developments, central banks all over the world have proceeded to slash interest rates to help boost consumer confidence, primarily by making borrowing easier. However, with a second coronavirus wave expected to sweep the planet by the end of the year, fears of further increased volatility still loom large on the horizon.Despite the disorder that seems to have engulfed the global financial sector, it’s worth pointing out that since May, Bitcoin’s (BTC) value has not strayed beyond the $9,000–$10,000 range, barring a few short-lived exceptions.As a result of this newfound, albeit possibly temporary stability, a lot of casual investors have started to give more credence to the notion that Bitcoin may finally be morphing into the stable asset class that many had initially envisioned it to be.Furthermore, this theory has gained even more ground since March’s “Black Thursday” crash that saw Bitcoin and gold — another well-regarded traditional store of value — exhibiting a stronger correlation following the event. Providing his insights on the matter to Cointelegraph, Jeffery Liu Xun, CEO of XanPool — a peer-to-peer fiat gateway — stated:“No one will dispute the strengthening of Bitcoin’s perception among the traditional finance class. This is in part due to Bitcoin’s continuous market performance and resilience, but also largely due to traditional hedge fund managers like Paul Jones openly promoting Bitcoin, positioning Bitcoin as a hedge against the inflationary global financial policy.”Additionally, according to crypto data analytics firm Coin Metrics, the above-mentioned correlation has never been observed historically and seems to suggest that more people are beginning to view Bitcoin as a digital safe haven. However, when it comes to comparing the price action of the two assets, BTC seems to have outperformed gold.With that being said, prior to Bitcoin’s current stable position, the currency was very recently faced with periods of unprecedented volatility. Throughout the last couple of years, drops of $2,000 to $4,000 could be seen happening on a near-weekly basis — so much so, that throughout the course of 2018, BTC’s value dropped from a relative high of around $14,300 to a shade under $4,000. In this regard, during the exact same time period, the value of gold showcased a staggeringly low level of volatility, sticking to a price range of roughly $1,200 to $1,360 for the entire year.Lastly, even though many are gushing about the renewed market confidence in Bitcoin, it is worth remembering that following the flagship crypto’s much-hyped halving event that took place in May, the currency’s value remained almost flat, and its volatility levels are now seeing record lows.When examining the issue of BTC’s current lack of price action, it is worth pointing out that if one were to look at the currency’s value movements at this exact point following its 2016 halving cycle, it would become quite apparent that the asset was behaving pretty much in the same way as it is now. In fact, it was a year and a half after its 2016 halving, around mid-December 2017, that BTC proceeded to reach its all-time high value of around $20,000.Additionally, the volatility and uncertainty surrounding traditional financial markets have failed to translate into a direct increase in demand for Bitcoin, as the coronavirus-induced panic has seemingly highlighted the need for alternative monetary systems rather than pushed Bitcoin to the center of the global finance stage. For example, when the coronavirus began to grip the world at the start of the year, BTC fell from almost $8,000 to around $3,600 on some exchanges all in the span of less than three days between March 11 and 13, placing its safe-haven status under question.Similarly, when stock markets all over the world were fluctuating wildly all throughout May, BTC also followed suit by mirroring the value drops being showcased by many traditional assets and commodities across the board, thereby worsening its perceived stability in front of investors all over the globe. On top of all this, the currency’s poor usability also seems to have limited its potential for widespread adoption at the time when it counted. On the subject, Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX — an India-based crypto trading platform — commented:“Let’s also not forget, this is the first time that we’re experiencing a global economic meltdown of this magnitude. Considering the global economic situation, it’s great to see Bitcoin prices being stable and strong.”Similarly, Ethan Taub, CEO of Loanry — a platform that connects people with lenders to source funds for their projects — believes that the Bitcoin market has been partially halted because of a lack of buying and selling. Though mostly dormant, he believes that after this period of stagnation, there may be a drop in value, following which, BTC will experience a price surge.Another potential cause for the ongoing stagnation could be due to many people recently losing their jobs and thus refraining from any risky trading activities. On the subject, the International Labor Organization has projected that during the second quarter of 2020 alone, more than 400 million people across the globe lost their jobs. The aforementioned job loss numbers are already 10 times greater than what was observed after the 2008 recession.Despite Bitcoin struggling to break past the $10,000 barrier for a few months running, the market at large seems to be quite confident in the premier crypto asset’s long-term potential. For example, a new crypto outlook report released by Bloomberg earlier in July shows that the report’s analysts are optimistic regarding BTC and believe it could very well approach the $12,000 threshold in the coming weeks or months.To back up their claims, the analysts stated that due to the current economic climate, more people are beginning to understand the utility of crypto and how it can act to alleviate inflation-related issues. Not only that, but they also highlighted BTC’s recent low volatility in relation to major stock indices such as the Nasdaq as being a clear indicator that the currency is primed for big things in the near future. The report reads as follows: “Unparalleled global central-bank easing and rising gold values are enduring trends favoring a higher Bitcoin price.”"
418,"In its finalized strategy for the next four years, released on July 8, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission has made comprehensive crypto regulation a priority.“We will develop a holistic framework to promote responsible innovation in digital assets,” the new framework promises within its strategic objectives.The new framework puts out goals for the next four years, up until 2024, which is when current Chairman Heath Tarbert’s term is scheduled to end. The broad strategy includes heavily pro-innovation language, for which Tarbert and predecessors at the CFTC are well-known in the crypto community.The release applauded developments in derivatives on digital assets and general digitization of trading over recent years:“Financial markets quickly adopt emerging technologies, and our derivatives markets have experienced an amazing digital transformation.”The CFTC handles regulation and enforcement of derivatives markets, as well as fraud and market manipulation within commodity trading. As today’s announcement notes, “exchanges specializing in futures relating to digital assets” have entered into the CFTC’s purview, including the recent addition of Ether futures to options in the U.S. market.Just yesterday, CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert commented on the importance of cooperation with co-regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission in establishing guidelines for crypto assets. The new guidelines similarly aim to “Harmonize regulations for market participants subject to concurrent CFTC and SEC jurisdiction.”"
419,"The United States Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department have published minimal guidance on the tax treatment of virtual currency and no guidance on Simple Agreement for Future Tokens or secondary forward contracts on SAFTs. Accordingly, it is difficult to determine the appropriate U.S. federal income tax treatment of a secondary forward contract on a SAFT.In 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014-21 and updated it with FAQs that provided that convertible virtual currency is treated as “property and general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.” Thus, a corporation’s issuance of such virtual currency tokens is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes.Although there is no definitive guidance, it is likely that digital tokens underlying SAFTs would be considered property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In light of limited guidance classifying tokens as property, some practitioners have attempted to embed terms and rights into the token instrument, causing such a token to be classified as equity, or less frequently, debt under fundamental tax principles. A corporation that issues equity or debt is not taxable on the issuance of either.If a virtual currency token is classified as property for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a SAFT, which entitles the holder to receive a certain number of tokens upon issuance, might be characterized as an executory contract, or a forward contract, to buy the virtual currency token. A “traditional forward contract” has been defined as an executory contract pursuant that the buyer agrees to purchase from the seller a fixed quantity of property at a fixed price, with payment and delivery to occur on a fixed future date. Section 1259(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides this for purposes of section 1259, “forward contract means a contract to deliver a substantially fixed amount of property (including cash) for a substantially fixed price.”Several federal tax cases and published rulings provide that forward contracts to acquire property are open transactions for federal income tax purposes and no taxable event should occur until the seller delivers legal title and possession of the property to the buyer. However, almost all of these authorities address circumstances, in which a buyer, upon entering into the contract, either does not make an upfront payment, pays a refundable deposit to the seller or pays a non-refundable amount that represents a relatively low percentage of the ultimate purchase price.In contrast, many SAFTs require upfront payments, which constitute a significant portion of the ultimate purchase price of a fixed number of tokens that are subject to the SAFT. This factor weighs against open transaction treatment for a SAFT because a significant non-refundable prepayment suggests that a taxable sale has occurred and authority is distinguishable.In Revenue Ruling 2003-7, the IRS held that a seller of stock that is the subject of a variable prepaid forward contract escapes constructive sale treatment both under common law principles and because section 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is inapplicable due to the variable amount of stock that is required to be delivered to the buyer pursuant to the contract.If the token does not yet exist because it is under construction, it is possible that even with the substantial upfront payment, the SAFT might still be considered to be a forward contract subject to open transaction treatment for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the corporate issuer might be able to defer income until the date of the issuance of the token to the SAFT holder in satisfaction of the SAFT. And a different conclusion might be reached if the issuance of tokens is imminent.What happens when the holder of a SAFT enters into a forward contract and accepts payment for the future delivery of a fixed number of the tokens underlying the SAFT? The issue is whether the SAFT holder is treated as constructively selling the SAFT upon entering into the prepaid forward contract in exchange for a significant cash payment approximately equal to the purported fair market value of the SAFT.The taxation of the secondary forward contract seller may differ from the taxation of the corporate seller/issuer of the SAFT, who cannot provide the token because it does not exist yet. The SAFT itself may be an appreciated financial position because later-issued SAFTs with respect to the same to-be-issued token cost more — i.e., are issued at a smaller discount to the face value of the token — or because the fair market value of the SAFT on the secondary market has appreciated.A secondary forward contract with respect to a SAFT seems to be much closer to the constructive sale fact pattern outlined by section 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is distinguishable from common law and IRS authorities, which permit open transaction treatment either due to small upfront payments or due to the terms of a limited class of variable prepaid forward contracts.Currently, section 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies to an appreciated position (including a forward contract) in stock, a debt instrument or a partnership interest “if there would be gain were such position sold, assigned, or otherwise terminated at its fair market value.”Section 1259 does not currently appear to apply to an interest in virtual currency tokens. However, there is a significant risk that a prepaid secondary forward contract on a SAFT could be a constructive sale. If Congress extended section 1259 to apply to virtual currency tokens or the IRS determined that based on the certain compelling facts, the common law constructive sale rules apply to cause a secondary forward contract on a SAFT to trigger a constructive sale of such SAFT.The lack of guidance on tokens, SAFTs and secondary forward contracts on SAFTs means that it is virtually impossible to determine the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the various instruments with certainty and whether or not a constructive sale occurs upon entering into one or more of these agreements. Therefore, SAFT holders who enter into a secondary forward contract on the SAFT should consult their tax advisors to determine whether (based on the specific facts of the transaction) entering into the secondary forward contract likely results in a constructive sale of the SAFT for tax purposes and the applicable tax reporting requirements.Since their inception, the issuance of SAFTs has presented difficult and controversial legal issues under the securities, commodities and tax laws in the U.S. In the meantime, secondary transfers of interests in existing SAFTs similarly present a set of difficult issues and risks that should be carefully considered by both prospective sellers and buyers in consultation with their legal advisers.This is part two of a two-part series on the Simple Agreement for Future Token — read part one here.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article was co-authored by Daniel Budofsky, Laura Watts, Riaz A.

420,"The first two days of Unitize, the virtual conference organized by BlockShow and San Francisco Blockchain Week, have come and gone with speakers from various sectors of the emerging crypto and blockchain space. Developments around central bank digital currencies, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on the industry, have taken center stage during the first two days of the event.The COVID-19 outbreak continues to dominate discourse across the social, political, economic and several other facets of human life. Thus, it was unsurprising to see the novel coronavirus featured in multiple panels across the first two days of the event sponsored by crypto derivatives exchange Bybit.According to Juan Otero, CEO of Travala — a Binance-backed blockchain travel agency — the Travala platform saw a 90% drop in bookings due to COVID-19. With many countries locking down their national borders, the global hospitality business is arguably one of the industries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.However, with countries beginning to open up for summer tourism, the travel industry might be seeing a reprieve. Speaking at Unitize, Otero revealed that domestic bookings increased by 160% in June.As part of the recovery efforts, Otero announced Travala’s partnership with global travel bookings giant Expedia. The collaboration will see the adoption of crypto payments for Expedia’s network of over 700,000 hotels.Despite the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, Balaji Srinivasan, general partner at venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, said the pandemic will trigger faster crypto and blockchain adoption. Speaking at the conference on Monday, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase remarked that perceived government overreach in managing the crisis will push people toward crypto, adding:“Ultimately, there are two modalities that people can accept: A, we have total power; B, no one has power over us. On the other hand of the spectrum you have Bitcoin, which is open state, open source, open execution, totally inspectable, totally transparent, based on mathematics and no one has power over it.”According to Srinivasan, people keen on preserving their fundamental rights will see crypto and blockchain as a viable means of escaping unfavorable government policies. Echoing Srinivasan’s comments, Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of CoinShares, declared that Bitcoin will feature prominently in the changing geopolitical landscape. According to Demirors, Bitcoin is leading the way to becoming “resistance money.”While Bitcoin might offer financial freedom to people across the world, Dan Morehead, founder of crypto VC firm Pantera Capital, sees altcoins outperforming Bitcoin in the next few years. Appearing at Unitize, Morehead predicted that altcoins with smaller market capitalizations will see greater price gains than BTC in the near future.China continues to lead the way in terms of CBDC development with its digital currency electronic payment, or DCEP, project. According to Matthew Graham, CEO of Sino Global Capital, China’s sovereign digital currency has its eyes on challenging the United States dollar’s domination of international trade.Appearing at Unitize on Monday, Graham argued that authorities in Beijing see the DCEP as an opportunity to internationalize the yuan. The veteran investment banker also revealed that the digital yuan will play a pivotal role in shaping domestic monetary policies.Apart from China, several countries are currently developing their own CBDC plans. For Douglas Arner, director of the Asian Institute of International Financial Law at the University of Hong Kong, blockchain interoperability will play a pivotal role in the success of these endeavors.Speaking on day two of the blockchain conference, Arner remarked that establishing interface points between CBDC projects will constitute a major hurdle for many countries. According to Arner, the absence of interoperability will limit the effectiveness of CBDC projects in international trade. Arner pointed to the DCEP and China’s ability to leverage relationships with countries around the world, adding:“If we think of the Chinese [CBDC] proposal at the moment, it is largely limited to operating within the context of the physical and electronic borders. But one can imagine how in the context of those electronic borders, if one integrates the system with, say, the RMB swap lines that are engaged in a range of different countries, that sort of RMB electronic area can be expanded outside.”Additionally, Arner also pointed to CBDC projects from the U.S. and the European Union as having the potential to enjoy such international leverage. While some national stablecoin projects might face adoption difficulties, Peter Dittus, chief economist of SFB Technologies, does not see a path to success for privately issued stablecoins. At the conference on Tuesday, Dittus predicted a bleak future for private stablecoins. For CBDCs, however, he remarked that such projects showed significant promise.Ditus also echoed similar sentiments to those espoused by Arner, stating that CBDCs would only be as successful as the countries that issue them. According to Dittus, no one is going to be interested in a sovereign digital coin minted by a nation suffering from crippling hyperinflation.On the blockchain front, Singapore continues to establish itself as a hub for the adoption of distributed ledger technology. On Monday, a group of Singaporean DLT firms showcased a map of the country’s blockchain landscape, revealing a 50% growth in the industry over the past year. Singaporean DLT firms are reportedly making forays into the expanding decentralized finance market.Meanwhile, blockchain giants Cosmos, Polkadot and Terra are partnering to launch a new DeFi savings service called Anchor. Revealed at Unitize on Monday, Anchor will allow users to deposit stablecoins for staking on supported proof-of-stake blockchains and earn passive income.Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood also identified Polkadot’s governance system as a viable means of creating an architecture for blockchain interoperability. According to Wood, Polkadot’s metaprotocol could allow for DLT networks to evolve autonomously.For Paul Gadi, chief technology officer of Outplay Games, blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt several facets of the gaming industry. In his appearance at Unitize, Gadi identified asset ownership, decentralized identity and storage as aspects of the gaming space primed for DLT utilization.According to a recent report from LeadBlock Partners, funding is a problem for European blockchain firms. But billionaire investor Tim Draper is certain that initial public offerings are not the solution for the industry. Speaking at the virtual blockchain conference, the venture capitalist and crypto investor advised startups against going public unless their firms are valued above $10 billion.According to Draper, the cost of compliance with the IPO process makes it an unsuitable fundraising vehicle for blockchain startups. Instead, Draper offered VC firms and tokenization as alternative routes for obtaining capital."
421,"The Bolivarian National Guard of Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, seized 315 Bitcoin (BTC) mining machines manufactured by Bitmain. The owners of the mining rigs were told that they did not possess the necessary permits to own and operate the machines. They also were not authorized to be transporting the machines during the COVID-19 quarantine.According to current legislation, Venezuelan citizens who are interested in conducting crypto-related mining activities must obtain the appropriate permits from a government office called the National Superintendence of Cryptoactives. Owners who fail to obtain these permits risk being fined, and having their equipment confiscated."
422,"Max Bronstein, who works on the Institutional Coverage team at Coinbase, believes “fireworks” are coming to the global currency market. What’s more, a spike in volatility of currencies might largely benefit the price of Bitcoin (BTC).He said:“A lot has been said on BTC's performance during bouts of equity volatility, but not as much on how BTC would perform during bouts of FX/currency volatility. With global currency vols off historic lows and a huge wave of new debt, fireworks are coming to the currency market.”Even before the pandemic hit the international economy, Bronstein noted that the global monetary system was fragile. Many countries are at risk of seeing their currencies decline in value due to various reasons.The analyst said that currencies are vulnerable due to the low dollar reserves and high dollar-denominated debts of many nations.Global currency volatility drops to a record low. Source: Bloomberg, JPMorganCurrencies with a history of hyperinflation are at risk of observing a similar trend in the near-term. Bronstein pinpointed the Argentine Peso, the Turkish Lira, and the Brazilian Real as examples of currencies with low dollar reserves.The Argentine Peso, for instance, recorded an inflation rate of 42.1% in May 2020, according to data from Trading Economics. Bitcoin price could benefit as the fear of hyperinflation, massive currency volatility and devaluation hits, says the analyst.The inflation rate of the Argentine Peso. Source: Trading EconomicsBronstein explained:“In all of these cases, currency vol and weakness will primarily stem from a government's need to devalue their currency. Bitcoin sits in stark contrast as it can't be debased by a central party. In a regime where nearly every government has an incentive to debase their currency, few monetary systems stand to benefit as much as Bitcoin does. Never before has an open-source competitor to fiat currency been so needed.”The historic low volatility of the global currency market does not indicate that a massive movement will occur in the immediate-term. It also does not suggest that it will cause a near-term spike in demand for Bitcoin.In the long-term, however, concerns around devaluation and hyperinflation could spur a steady demand for Bitcoin. The positive effect on BTC might snowball if the perception of the top cryptocurrency as a store-of-value improves, particularly following the V-shape recovery of Bitcoin since its plunge to sub-$3,600 in March, which has shown its survivability.Meanwhile, several other countries are struggling with similar issues pertaining to hyperinflation or devaluation of national currencies. Iran and Venezuela, for instance, have seen reports of Bitcoin operating as a means of payment and unconfiscatable digital money as their respective national currencies have experienced hyperinflation in recent years.In the long-term, as the on-ramp infrastructure supporting Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies improves, there exists a strong possibility that BTC is used as a currency, possibly alongside existing currencies."
423,"Monex Securities, a major Japanese online securities company, launched a cryptocurrency contract-for-difference service today. This marks the first time that a major online Japanese securities company has offered a crypto CFD. A CFD is a type of derivative in which the ""buyer"" of the contract pays the ""seller"" the difference between the current price of an asset and the price of that asset at a future date stipulated in the contract. According to a Monex announcement on July 8, the CFD is available for Bitcoin (BTC)/yen, Ether (ETH)/yen, XRP/yen,  and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)/yen trading pairs. The leverage rate limit is 2x. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Monex said they would consider adding new coins after considering “demand, liquidity risks, price fluctuations risk and crypto blockchain network risk."" Monex Securities' parent company, Monex Group, also runs Coincheck, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan. On May 1, the Japanese government enforced the revised Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (FIEL). According to this new law, every business involved in offering crypto derivatives trading is required to be registered as a Financial Instrument Business.Monex Securities will offer the new crypto derivative service as a financial instrument regulated by the FIEL."
424,"Bitcoin (BTC) was the top choice of famous analyst PlanB thanks to its scarcity and zero likelihood of negative interest rates.In a series of tweets on July 7, the creator of Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow price model explained what drove him to buy the cryptocurrency.PlanB has become well known as an outspoken BTC supporter. His price model has undergone several incarnations, and currently predicts a Bitcoin price of $288,000 by 2024.So far, stock-to-flow has tracked Bitcoin’s metamorphosis with almost 100% accuracy. Before he created it, however, PlanB was eyeing macro factors and an exit from fiat currency.He wrote on Twitter:“Why I bought #bitcoin in 2015-2016 (before the model): - 46M millionaires in the world, only 21M BTC - can't use gold or $ in space or Mars, need something else - nobody can freeze account or block transactions - 0% interest rate is better than negative interest rate”The reasoning will sound familiar to many. Bitcoin’s fixed supply, non-physical nature, decentralized structure, and “hard” money credentials continue to make it an investment choice for both large and small volume investors.Since 2015, negative interest rates, in particular, have proliferated, with Bitcoin offering a safe haven from central bank taxes and the erosion of the value of cash savings.Continuing, PlanB said that mainstream consumers were still unaware of Bitcoin’s benefits as money.“It is funny isn't it? In The Netherlands people have about $400B on their bank savings accounts, earning 0% interest (above $1M interest rate is negative),” he wrote in another post. “This $400B could be put in bitcoin and put to work to earn at least 6% interest, $24B/yr. Most people in NL are asleep ..yet”Bitcoin stock-to-flow price model as of July 8. Source: DigitalikAs Cointelegraph has often highlighted, Bitcoin rewards low time preference investors by not incentivizing spending or borrowing as quickly as possible. The opposite is true of fiat, issuers of which use negative rates and inflationary policy to penalize long-term savers.At the same time, miners are incentivized not to alter Bitcoin’s fundamental attributes — fixed supply and fixed emission — as doing so would compromise their own prosperity.As Saifedean Ammous summarized in his popular book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” this form of “digital scarcity” is unprecedented in history, and allows Bitcoin to fill a niche that no other money has yet managed, including gold."
425,"Within the last few hours, the Bitcoin (BTC) price pushed above $9,300 after struggling to hold the $9,300–$9,400 level for the past three days. The move was accompanied by a notable surge in purchasing volume, which is exactly what was needed given that on July 6 and 7, the Bitcoin price formed a tweezer top and rejected at $9,374.

Traders will be watching to see if the price can secure a four-hour close above $9,300, and if Bitcoin can push through the $9,450 level, then a surge to $9,600 is likely.

426,"Most younger crypto holders don’t have any kind of plan to pass down their digital assets when they die.According to a survey conducted among 1,150 participants between October 2019 and June  2020 by the Cremation Institute, the majority of crypto holders are concerned about passing on their assets after they die, but a large proportion fail to use wills, trusts, or proper instructions for beneficiaries. This lack of preparation, according to the institute, is due to a lack of estate services focusing on crypto assets and a lack of government regulation.The study recorded 89% of investors saying they worried on some level about whether their crypto assets would be transferred to their family or friends following their death, with no respondents saying they were “not at all” concerned. Source: Cremation InstituteHowever, younger generations — those between 18-40 years old — are more than likely to have no kind of plan at all for their digital assets when they pass on. Only 65% of Millennials and 41% of Zoomers said they had left some kind of instructions for their digital assets. Older generations — 86% of those from Generation X and 94% of Baby Boomers — reported having a plan to pass on their crypto holdings. For those that reported having a plan, the majority — 65% — said they left instructions for their assets around the home where supposedly a beneficiary could easily find them. Only 2% used “secure” solutions like safety deposit boxes, and 32% reported using USB sticks or computers for storing instructions. The study found that crypto holders were four times less likely to use wills for inheritances — 7%, compared to 32% of non-crypto investors — a result the institute called “quite alarming.”According to the Cremation Institute’s Adam Binstock, the study was conducted after “hearing about the horror stories of people dying with their assets.”Cryptocurrency insurance company Coincover estimates that nearly 4 million Bitcoin (BTC) — more than $37 billion — are effectively out of circulation after access was lost.One of the most famous incidents of a large number of digital assets lost supposedly after death is from Gerry Cotten, the founder of QuadrigaCX. When he died in India in 2018, without ever passing on the keys to $145 million in tokens, many suspected that he had faked his own death. However the Ontario Securities Commission has since come out and said the exchange was actually a Ponzi scheme created by Cotton.Another case in 2017 involved a man who amassed a large amount of Bitcoin on Coinbase, but died without leaving behind instructions for his family on how to access them. The family was able to present evidence of his death and their relationship to the platform to get access to the funds. Had the Bitcoin not been held in a U.S-based exchange or had they not been U.S. citizens themselves, the process could easily have been more complicated.Some companies have launched services to address these issues. Inheriti, a digital asset inheritance service from platform Safe Haven is now in beta and will launch soon. The Cremation Institute report states that McLeod Law attorney Matthew Burgoyne believes there will be a surge in the number of AI-based third-party services which manage private keys in the event of death.The Cremation Institute is composed of experts, contributors, and researchers who “create important end-of-life resources for individuals and families.”"
427,"Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos says he would like to see more privacy features on Bitcoin, but they’re unlikely to happen anytime soon.In a livestream Q&A on Antonopoulos’ YouTube channel on July 7, he said Bitcoin (BTC) was unlikely to ever implement privacy features similar to those used by Monero (XMR).Antonopoulos said creating such features on a cryptocurrency like BTC “would create an enormous amount of controversy.” In addition, he said the structure of Bitcoin simply doesn’t allow ring signatures and stealth addresses.“I think what we’re going to see soon is Schnorr, Taproot, and Tapscript, which open the door to a lot of improvements,” Antonopoulos said, “But they still do not involve zero-knowledge proofs or the types of ring signatures and stealth addresses that are done in Monero. Bitcoin is not a privacy coin.”The features to which Antonopoulos is referring — Schnorr, Taproot, and Tapscript (a scripting update to Taproot) — have been cited by others in the crypto community as having the potential to make Bitcoin more private. The director of research at blockchain firm Blockstream Andrew Poelstra has referred to Taproot as a system which could possibly render any transaction mostly indistinguishable from one another on the BTC blockchain. However, he noted that “transaction amounts and the transaction graph are still exposed, which are much harder problems to address.” Multisignature schemes (MuSigs) from Schnorr are another possibility. Poelstra said using this method doesn’t reveal the original set of signers, or even provide the number of signers for MuSig transactions. Bitcoin can be better thought of as pseudonymous rather than fully anonymous, as many transactions on the BTC blockchain can still be traced even with these privacy improvements."
428,"Cryptocurrency has a starring role in a new casino heist action movie starring Adam Copeland, Denise Richards, and Kelsey Grammer that premieres later this week.According to the trailer, Money Plane (out July 10) is about a former gambler who is pushed into stealing from an aircraft that’s “a bulletproof casino in the sky, untouchable by any government agency”. Grammer’s character says the plane carries “up to a billion on board in crypto and millions in cash.” While not identifying which coins are essential to the plot, a screen capture shows the Money Plane has at least $241 million in Bitcoin (BTC), $128 million in Ethereum (ETH), $70 million in Ripple (XRP), $13 million in Litecoin (LTC), and an undetermined amount of Iota (MIOTA). Screenshot from “Money Plane” trailerReddit user JokeOlantern said movies like Money Plane could help create greater visibility for digital assets, but questioned if it would “only show crypto associated with casinos and dangerous criminals.”Others like user Micro56 had similar concerns around the disconnect between Hollywood and reality: “Media portrayals like this [are] almost a necessity for explaining new technology like crypto. I remember the ridiculous movie/TV scenes used to portray the internet back in the day.”Though crypto hasn’t quite achieved mass adoption in 2020, it seems to be the year for tokens on the silver screen. Cointelegraph reported in June that Stampede Ventures would be producing a movie based on the best-selling book Bitcoin Billionaires, the story of Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss."
429,"Over the past three weeks, $150,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) $50K call options for June and December 2021 strikes have been traded. LedgerX derivatives exchange has been intermediating these ultra bullish trades, but what could be the rationale behind them?There are some good reasons for buying options with such small odds, but paying $1,000 for the privilege of purchasing Bitcoin 440% above the current price in 18 months seems unreasonable. Even considering an annual 100% volatility, which is quite high even for Bitcoin’s standards, the probability that the price will reach $50,000 is less than 8%.The seller of this call option has unlimited downside if price somehow manages to surpass the $51,000 level and for this commitment the seller is paid the $1,000 upfront.For comparison, the December 2021 call option with a $25,000 strike has been trading at $1,750. Such a buyer will profit $13,250 if Bitcoin price reaches $40,000, which is a healthy 650% return. On the other hand, the $50,000 strike buyer would gain nothing from this massive bull run to $40,000.Recently, crypto media and crypto-Twitter have been intensely focused on options and futures instruments but in reality, it makes no sense for retail traders to buy pricey options, even for the most bullish ones. There’s really no way to know the rationale that drives these immensely optimistic investors, although this could be a bull call spread.In this scenario, the investor would be buying the more expensive $25,000 call option, while selling the $50,000 one. This makes more sense as it reduces the current expenditure to $750 from $1,750 along with the benefit of profiting massively from a potential bull run.Profit/Loss for Bull Call Spread. Source: Optioncreator.comThe above chart depicts the return for such a bull call spread trade. Although it is still very optimistic, this strategy provides positive returns for levels above $25,750.Back in December 2017, Blocktower Capital paid $1 million for $50K call options maturing in twelve months. In late 2018, Blocktower CIO Ari Paul explained that it was a volatility trade carried out as they simultaneously sold BTC and other assets. There’s no way to estimate the trade’s profit or loss, but the $1 million premium definitively has been lost.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

430,"Dan Morehead, the founder of the first crypto venture capital firm, Pantera Capital, believes that altcoins will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the next couple of years.Speaking at the Unitize virtual event, Morehead said that in the short-term, his firm is betting on altcoins:“And it's our opinion that these altcoins and particularly smaller cap smart contract tokens are going to outperform Bitcoin over the next couple of years.”He emphasized that it would be incorrect to suggest that Pantera does not believe in Bitcoin. Rather, they are of the opinion that smaller coins will go up in value more:“We think Bitcoin is going to go up a ton, but altcoins will go up even more. An example is Bitcoin is up about 30 percent year to date, which is amazing. Given that equities are down and real estate's down and almost all assets are down in price. But other things in the cryptocurrency space are up much more, Ethereum is up 80% and then other smaller projects like Augur (REP) and 0x (ZRX) are up 100% on the year.”Pantera is an investor in Augur and 0x; however, it missed out on the Ethereum (ETH) initial coin offering back in 2015.Digital assets outperforming traditional asset classes should incentivize more institutional interest in the space."
431,"The enfant terrible of the digital token world, the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, or SAFT, continues to grab headlines. In the recent Telegram case, the federal district court for the Southern District of New York enjoined Telegram Group Inc. from proceeding with its long-planned token generation event, finding not only that the issuance of their tokens, Telegram Open Network, would violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 but that the initial placement of SAFTs constituted an illegal unregistered offering of securities. On June 26, 2020, the court approved a settlement between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Telegram that included an $18.5-million civil penalty, the return of some $1.22 billion to investors and a three-year requirement to notify the SEC before issuing digital assets. That settlement extinguished the appeal, leaving the decision as the final legal determination. The SEC has made similar arguments in the case of the Canadian startup Kik last year. Nonetheless, billions of dollars of SAFTs have been issued by other issuers of which many remain outstanding and are subject to potential secondary market trading. Although there have been variations, in a quintessential SAFT offering, an issuer raises funds to finance the development of a platform that will be driven by tokens by selling to investors a SAFT that represents the right to receive an allotment of tokens once the platform is launched. The purchase price is paid upon receipt of the SAFT, and the number of tokens to be delivered in settlement is determined on the date of the token generation event, usually at a discount to the public purchase price. For many issuers, numerous delays in launching the platform have caused SAFT holders to look for pre-launch exits, and as anticipated launch dates approach, other investors look for ways of buying tokens at discounted prices. Thus, there is a natural supply and demand for secondary transfers of SAFTs. However, such secondary sales are complicated by a number of contractual and regulatory factors, which are discussed in turn below.Most SAFTs are subject to contractual transfer restrictions that prohibit the assignment of the SAFT contract or any rights thereunder to a third party without the prior written consent of the issuer. While it may be feasible to acquire the issuer’s consent to transfer a SAFT, many SAFT holders may feel constrained by relationship considerations from signaling to the issuer that they are seeking to exit their investment. Similarly, SAFT issuers may be disinclined from consenting to such transfers to avoid: (1) any implication that they are encouraging the growth of a secondary market; (2) the complexities of policing transfer restrictions; and (3) the cost of reviewing and approving transfers, and may only agree to transfers to affiliates. Some transfer restrictions contain exceptions for partnerships or funds that wish to distribute assets pro rata to their partners or investors. To the extent such entities were the initial investors in a SAFT, distributions to their investors, whether old or new, may be possible within the contractual restrictions.Alternatively, SAFT holders may gain liquidity by entering into a forward contract with a secondary investor for the tokens underlying the SAFT — a “secondary forward contract.” Whether this approach is permissible or not depends in large part on how strict the transfer restrictions are defined in the SAFT. Questions that would need to be answered include, but are not limited to: (1) Do the transfer restrictions apply to transfers of the underlying tokens or only the SAFT itself? and (2) Do the transfer restrictions encompass indirect transfers or transfers of the economic rights under a SAFT? Assuming counsel can get comfortable that a secondary forward contract is permissible under the SAFT’s transfer restrictions, a number of difficult regulatory issues then arise.A secondary forward contract can be understood as a physically settled contingent prepaid forward contract obligating the seller to deliver certain tokens, if and when issued, to the buyer in exchange for the payment of an upfront purchase price. The regulatory treatment of this type of prepaid forward contract will depend in large part on the legal characterization of the underlying tokens: Are they securities, commodities or “something else?”Whether a digital token is a security under the U.S. securities laws has been the central issue facing initial coin offerings and SAFTs since inception and has been the primary subject of many court cases and regulatory writings, including the SEC’s Report of Investigation on the DAO, numerous SEC enforcement actions and the SEC’s Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets. The legal analysis of whether a digital token is a security hinges on the application of the Howey Test. Much has been written on this question, however, we will not review the application of the Howey Test to digital assets here. But note that many SAFTs were based on the legal theory that, although the SAFT itself was a security which would be sold to investors in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, the tokens, once generated, would not be securities. However, in a number of cases, the SEC and courts have found that the tokens underlying SAFTs were securities.Assuming that the tokens, when generated and issued, are securities, the question becomes: How do the securities laws apply to the forward sale of such tokens by the holder of a SAFT to a third-party buyer? We may assume that the SAFT holder is on-selling “restricted securities” — i.e., securities that were acquired in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving a public offering. Conventional analysis would proceed as follows: Under the Securities Act, every offer and sale of a security requires registration with the SEC unless a valid exemption from registration is available. Section 4(a)(1) exempts transactions “by a person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.” A person is an “underwriter” under section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act if they acquire securities with a view to “distribution” or are participating in a “distribution,” which, as a practical matter, can be understood to mean an offering that is not a private offering. A securities holder who wishes to resell them privately under section 4(a)(1), therefore, must sell in a transaction that is sufficiently “private” to avoid being considered an underwriter. The SEC and securities lawyers have come to accept a practice of imposing various restrictions on sale as permitting a resale to be eligible under section 4(a)(1). This practice is referred to as “Section 4(1-1/2).” Alternatively, a safe harbor from “underwriter” status is provided by rule 144 for public resales by holders of securities who have held securities for a minimum holding period and meet certain other requirements. Analyzed this way, a secondary forward contract would simply need to comply with the well-developed private resale restrictions under Section 4(1-1/2). ). An interesting question is whether sellers offer to sell and deliver those particular tokens, which they will receive upon settlement of the SAFT or, instead, offer generic tokens of the same class for sale. If the sellers were able to sell the tokens they received in settlement of the SAFT during a valid public sale at or around the time of settlement of the forward contract and use the proceeds to purchase new “clean” tokens — i.e., a “double print” — to be delivered under the forward contract, then arguably the seller is not offering restricted securities under the forward contract.A potential and significant roadblock, however, is the legal analysis applied by the Southern District of New York in the Telegram case. The court found that the initial placements of the SAFTs were not valid private placements and that the investors in those SAFTs were statutory underwriters with respect to the sale of the underlying tokens to the ultimate buyers once the token generation event occurs. This raises the question of whether the status of such investors as underwriters would also apply to such investors acquiring tokens through secondary forward contracts prior to the token generation event. If so, resales by such investors that are not registered under the Securities Act might be subject to SEC enforcement actions or eventual claims for rescission by disappointed buyers under section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act. The court’s interpretation may also create additional pitfalls for the unwary secondary forward contract participant. For example, rule 101 of Regulation M prohibits underwriters, among others, from bidding for, purchasing, or attempting to induce any other person to bid for or purchase a covered security for a specified period of time. Under the court’s interpretation, investors reselling tokens received in settlement of the SAFT as underwriters would be required to comply with the requirements of rule 101 of Regulation M. Such investors would also need to consider whether their resale activity constitutes “broker” activity as defined in section 3(4) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Non-compliance with Regulation M and the broker registration requirements of the Exchange Act is punishable by both fine and sanction.Assuming the underlying tokens acquired through secondary forward contracts are “commodities” within the meaning of the Commodities Exchange Act, then the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may have regulatory authority over secondary forward contracts, depending on whether the contract falls within the CFTC’s existing transactional jurisdictional buckets.Since its enforcement action against CoinFlip in September 2015, the CFTC has consistently taken the position in other enforcement actions, interpretive guidance and public statements that virtual currencies are “commodities,” as that term is defined in the CEA. The CFTC addressed the scope of the term “virtual currency” in its March 2020 Final Interpretive Guidance on Retail Commodity Transactions Involving Certain Digital Assets. There, the CFTC declined to create a bright-line definition but instead adopted a broad interpretation:“Virtual or digital currency: Encompasses any digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, and any other digital unit of account that is used as a form of a currency (i.e., transferred from one party to another as a medium of exchange); may be manifested through units, tokens, or coins, among other things; and may be distributed by way of digital ‘smart contracts,’ among other structures.”Assuming counsel concludes that the tokens underlying a secondary forward contract are “commodities,” then how should the secondary forward contract be analyzed under the CEA? As a first principle, the CFTC’s regulatory jurisdiction is limited to certain transactional buckets.Generally, these buckets include futures contracts, options on futures contracts and swaps, although the CFTC does have limited anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority over spot contracts on commodities. One would like to think that a forward sale of tokens should be no different from any commercial sale of a commodity — for example, a manufacturer of a sweet beverage buying corn syrup where the delivery is delayed for some period of time.Surely, these are not regulated by the CFTC. However, the analysis is much more nuanced. Such commercial forward contracts are unregulated only by virtue of specific, limited exclusions under the CEA. Under these exclusions, a forward contract is a commercial merchandizing contract between commercial parties contemplating deferred delivery of a non-financial commodity (such as an agricultural, energy or metals commodity) where delivery routinely occurs. These types of forward contracts are explicitly excluded from regulation as futures contracts. In addition, forward contracts on “non-financial commodities” (and on securities) are excluded from the definition of “swap” so long as the parties intend to physically settle the transactions. Thus, there are at least two possible reasons that the tokens underlying a secondary forward contract might not benefit from these exclusions: (1) they may be considered financial commodities and (2) investors or speculators may not be considered commercial merchants. Without an exclusion, a secondary forward contract would likely be deemed a “swap” by the CFTC.The most immediate consequence of this determination is that swaps may only be entered into between eligible contract participants, or ECPs. For individuals, this means having at least $10 million of gross assets invested on a discretionary basis or $5 million if the swap is to hedge an existing position. A swap entered into by parties who are not ECPs would be in violation of the CEA and CFTC regulation, and both parties could face penalties and sanctions. In addition, swaps are subject to certain reporting requirements. Thus, if secondary forward contracts are swaps, the number of potential qualified counterparties for such transactions may be limited.The lines between different types of digital assets can be complex and confusing. Industry commentators have pointed out technical distinctions between tokens, coins, digital currencies and virtual currencies. Some commentators have argued that certain tokens may be “utility tokens” with the implication that they are neither securities nor commodities. While it is possible that some tokens underlying SAFTs may fall between the jurisdictional cracks of the SEC and CFTC and, therefore, not be subject to any federal regulatory scrutiny, this appears highly unlikely.This is part one of a two-part series on the Simple Agreement for Future Token — read part two here.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article was co-authored by Daniel Budofsky, Laura Watts, Riaz A.

432,"Double-spending is an issue that has existed ever since Bitcoin’s (BTC) inception, and according to a recent report from ZenGo, it still persists across cryptocurrency wallets such as BRD, Ledger Live and Edge.Although these companies have updated their product offerings since ZenGo pointed out this discrepancy, it is speculated that millions of crypto users could have been exposed to this particular exploit, dubbed BigSpender. Ledger, one of the impacted crypto wallet firms, even claimed that this vulnerability is only a user experience flaw.Double-spending is a flaw that arises across digital cash platforms wherein a single digital token can be spent more than once. Although this is not a weakness that is unique to blockchain and cryptocurrency, it becomes a very significant issue for crypto users. With centralized currencies, this issue is solved by having a trusted third party in place that verifies if the token has already been spent.With decentralized currencies such as Bitcoin, the unique selling point is that they offer a system that is not linked to any central bank, with the double-spend issue attempting to be solved by having many servers store up-to-date copies of the public transaction ledger.The hurdle faced by this approach is that once broadcasted, transactions will reach each server at slightly different times, and if two transactions attempt to spend the same token, each server will consider the first to be valid and void the second transaction. If these two servers were to disagree then there would be no way to reconcile the true balance, as each server’s observation is considered valid. Cointelegraph spoke about the matter with Bilal Hammoud, founder and CEO of NDAX — a cryptocurrency exchange based in Canada — who said that despite recurring issues, Bitcoin does have a prevention system in place:“Bitcoin network utilized multiple measures to prevent such attacks such as time to produce 1 block which averages about 10 minutes and recommendation of 6 confirmation which makes it near impossible to reverse a transaction unless the attacker owns a significant network hash power.”There are myriad ways that a crypto user or an entity can double-spend. While some of these methods are legitimate, most are, unsurprisingly, fraudulent. Some of the well-known double-spending techniques are race attacks, Finney attacks, Vector76 attacks, the aforementioned BigSpender attack and the main threat to the Bitcoin network, 51% attacks.A race attack — also known as a replace-by-fee, or RBF, attack — happens when the merchant or receiving party accepts a transaction with zero confirmations. It is the most common double-spend, where a user sends a transaction to a merchant, and once the transaction has been accepted and goods are delivered, the attacker sends a conflicting transaction to another address with a higher transaction fee, forcing it to be validated before the original transaction. On this kind of attack, Hammoud commented:“These kinds of transactions are not always fraudulent. Exchanges like NDAX typically carry out these transactions as they control a Bitcoin node with a method that is called RBF (replace by fee) to reverse a transaction whereby the transaction fee was low and they need the transaction to go faster or if the user of the exchange sent to the wrong address and exchange attempt to reverse the transaction.”A Finney attack, however, is a fraudulent double-spend that relies heavily on network hash rate and requires participation from a miner. This type of attack is extremely rare in the current scenario, as it requires Bitcoin’s hash rate to be extremely low. A Vector76 attack is also a rare attack that is a combination of Finney and race attacks.The main threat to the Bitcoin network is a 51% attack, which could happen if a group of miners that control more than 51% of the network’s hashing power agrees to reorganize the transaction. This allows attackers to prevent new transactions from being confirmed by interrupting payments between some or even all users on that network. This attack also makes it possible to reverse transactions that were already completed, thus contributing to the double-spend issue. One of Bitcoin’s forks, Bitcoin Gold (BTG), was hit by such an attack twice, in 2018 and 2020. On this particular type of attack and attackers, Hammoud stated that Bitcoin is unlikely to be affected by it: “This type of attack is very unlikely as it threatens the entire network integrity, such an attack can only be coordinated if miners decide to destroy the entire bitcoin value rendering useless.” The way that crypto firms/wallets detect attempts to double-spend is through the use of hashes. A hash is created using an algorithm and is essential to blockchain management in cryptocurrency, as these long strings of numbers serve as proof-of-work. When a given set of data is run through a hash function, there can only be one unique hash that is generated. Any tiny change to the data will create a totally unrecognizable hash when compared with the one generated originally. The algorithms used to create such hashes are called consensus algorithms.Despite the use of these consensus algorithms on blockchain networks, there have been several instances of double-spends that have been detected where either the users or the firms themselves have been impacted. Gregory Klumov, founder and CEO of Stasis — an issuer of a euro-backed stablecoin — spoke to Cointelegraph on why the issue is still ongoing: “There are centralized and decentralized risks. In the first case, there are several points of failure hacking into which you can take ownership or take assets or whatever else. In the case of a decentralized network, most of it must be taken under control to carry out attacks. There is no alternative, so debates are happening which model will be sustainable in the longer run.”However, some believe this to be an inherent flaw in the system. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Evgen Verzun, founder of decentralized cloud platform Hypersphere, revealed: “This is one of the basic flaws, so system creators should always remember about it and design their consensus algorithm in a way to avoid it.” Hammoud, however, holds a more liberal view on the nature of double-spends, holding the attackers more liable than the system itself: “Double spend is not necessarily an issue or a design flaw. The majority of users use double-spend for legitimate reasons. [...] Unfortunately, some bad actors do take advantage of that and by simply following the rules above like waiting for the necessary confirmations and disabling incoming connections to a merchant node can simply stop 95% of these attacks.”Since crypto wallets could be considered merely a door to the blockchain or an access interface, there are only limited efforts that can be taken to negate the risk of double-spending, according to Hammoud, who said that wallets can implement rules that forbid setting low transaction fees or setting up a ledger system that places funds on hold. He added: “But unfortunately, there is no wallet that can be foolproof as an attacker can simply run their own node or extract their seed from wallet providers and use a third-party to execute the attack.”Since the current talk of the town is the recent RBF attack on various crypto wallet firms dubbed “BigSpender,” there are actions that merchants, users and firms can take to reduce the chances of these attacks in the future. Hammoud echoed the suggestions made by Verzun, noting: “Another measure would be also to implement a cool-down period where the wallet provider prevents users from exporting their private seed within 20 mins of sending a transaction or payment,” adding that:“Merchants and users can stop these attacks by waiting for 6 confirmation on the blockchain. Some merchants and companies can also accept less than 6 confirmation, by disabling incoming network connection and making sure they are connected to a well established node.”Though these solutions are simple in concept, they are often extremely difficult to implement. It’s now up to the security innovation processes of wallet firms, merchants and users alike to determine the chance of these double-spend fiascos happening in the future. These innovations should be a priority for all parties involved, given the monetary and, more importantly, reputational risks that impact merchants and ultimately the whole blockchain industry."
433,"A former key executive at the United States Department of the Treasury has joined a major cryptocurrency investigation firm, Chainalysis.Sigal Mandelker, a former Treasury Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, has reportedly joined Chainalysis’ board of advisors. As officially announced on July 7, the new position on the startup’s board comes alongside Mandelker’s participation in a Chainalysis’ extended $49 million Series B funding round.As reported by Forbes, the new position on the board marks Mandelker’s first public work since she left Trump’s White House for the private sector in October 2019. At the startup, the former Treasury exec will meet with the Chainalysis team to share insights on investigating crypto crimes as well as help them build new partnerships in both the public and private sectors.Chainalysis is a major crypto analytics firm and a primary source of crypto transaction data for federal agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI. Addressing the company’s broad cooperation scope, Mandelker highlighted that further development will be crucial for the future of the industry. She said:“The fact that they're building relationships, terrific relationships, both with financial institutions and with the government sector, including with law enforcement, is going to be really important for the future of this industry.”Mandelker is known for her 2019 crypto investigations involving three hacker groups that helped the North Korean government launder billions of dollars in cryptocurrency funds. According to official records, the former Treasury exec also played a role in convicting an illicit digital currency platform known as “E-Gold” back in 2008.Michael Gronager, co-founder and CEO at Chainalysis, told Cointelegraph that Mandelker’s entrance to Chainalysis will contribute to further adoption of the crypto industry. He said:“We believe that by getting regulators and law enforcement comfortable with cryptocurrency, financial institutions will more meaningfully invest in the space and cryptocurrency businesses will grow. Sigal brings a wealth of knowledge from her time at the Treasury Department to help us propel this flywheel of growth for the industry.""The news comes alongside Chainalysis expanding its Series B to $49 million after raising $36M in February 2019 from companies including venture capital giant Accel. The fresh $13M investment featured participation from venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, which invested in major crypto startups like Coinbase and Robinhood. Mandelker reportedly joined Ribbit Capital as general partner earlier in 2020.The new additional fundraising also included investment from Sound Ventures, a venture capital firm founded by actor Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary. In May 2020, Kutcher and Oseary also invested in major Bitcoin (BTC) rewards company Lolli."
434,"There are several well-known Bitcoin price models and theories that are often highly debated and considered controversial. Models like stock-to-flow, Hyperwave and Elliot Wave typically predict large price movements in the medium- to long-term.The first and most widely acknowledged Bitcoin price model is stock-to-flow. The S2F model predicts the long-term trend of Bitcoin’s value based on its scarcity. Since Bitcoin has a fixed monetary supply, the biggest value proposition of the dominant cryptocurrency is its scarcity and the reducing supply of BTC.The model takes the stock-to-flow of gold and silver as its benchmark. The term stock-to-flow refers to the flow of new supply relative to the amount of existing circulating supply. The model believes the value of gold held up over time because it is not possible to newly create all of the circulating supply of gold to render the precious metal worthless.Unlike gold and silver, the supply of Bitcoin is fixed, and every halving decreases the rate of supply production. As such, in theory, Bitcoin is even more scarce than gold and silver. The model predicts the market capitalization of Bitcoin to exceed $1 trillion after the May 2020 halving. The prediction goes in line with the performance of Bitcoin following previous halvings in 2012 and 2016. PlanB, the creator of the model, explained:“The predicted market value for Bitcoin after May 2020 halving is $1trn, which translates in a Bitcoin price of $55,000. That is quite spectacular. I guess time will tell and we will probably know one or two years after the halving.”The main criticism around stock-to-flow comes down to two main arguments. First, some say the assumption that gold’s value derives solely from scarcity is inaccurate. Second, others think that the use of linear regression might lead to imprecise predictions. Nico Cordeiro, the chief investment officer at Strix Leviathan crypto hedge fund, wrote:“From a theoretical foundation, the model is based on the rather strong assertion that the USD market capitalization of a monetary good (e.g. gold and silver) is derived directly from their rate of new supply. No evidence or research is provided to support this idea, other than the singular data points selected to chart gold and silver’s market capitalization against Bitcoin’s trajectory.”Cordeiro also argued that the use of linear regression to chart the S2F model poses a high probability of “spurious results.” The investor said that many random data points can be fit into the model as a result of the regression.But, it is difficult to state that the S2F model is correct or flawed, because there is not enough data to definitively reject the predictions made by the model. As an example, evidence is lacking to support that the value of gold is dependent on its scarcity. Yet, it is also challenging to prove that scarcity has not been the main catalyst of gold’s longevity as a store of value.The Elliott Wave Theory is widely utilized by technical analysts to determine market cycles. It spots both bearish and bullish cycles, by assuming that the market moves based on crowd psychology. Typically, the Elliott Wave Theory is applied in many bearish scenarios. It presents an eight-part move, where the price of the asset declines on a level-by-level basis.The Elliott Wave Theory is often criticized because it is considered to be highly subjective. It also assumes that the market follows the same crowd psychology across varying time frames. As such, it frequently leads to extreme price predictions for both bearish and bullish scenarios.A report on the Elliott Wave Theory by Binance Academy reads: “Critics argue that the Elliott Wave Theory isn’t a legitimate theory due to its highly subjective nature, and relies on a loosely defined set of rules.” However, it also makes note that, “There are thousands of successful investors and traders that have managed to apply Elliott’s principles in a profitable manner.”The Elliott Wave Theory is not a specific technical pattern or market structure. It is a principle that can be adopted by traders on how they see fit, depending on the price trend of an asset at a certain time. It is difficult to establish that the Elliott Wave Theory is inaccurate or flawed, because it does not set specific targets. It is up to traders and technical analysts that adopt the principle to assess crowd psychology of a certain market.The Hyperwave Theory, popularized within the cryptocurrency market by a well-established trader, Tone Vays, determines the formation of a potential bubble in the market. It is a seven-part market cycle that spots a bearish trend reversal typically at a peak. The Hyperwave structure is similar to the Elliott Wave principle, but it only pertains to bearish scenarios.Hyperwave-based price predictions are often controversial because they assume the peak of an asset has been hit. Consequently, it often leads to extreme predictions, calling for an 80% to 90% drop from a local top. For instance, Vays said that he used the Hyperwave Theory in early 2018 to call for a price target of $1,500. Over the next year and a half, the price of Bitcoin dropped from around $18,000 to $3,100. Referring to the Hyperwave Theory, Vays said: “I was off by 12%. That was my margin of error. When I called $1,500 (from the January 2018 top), I was only off by 12% on the low of the bear market.”In a recent discussion about the Hyperwave Theory, Vays said that the model is still calling for a $1,000 price point for Bitcoin. But Vays emphasized that it does not mean he is waiting for BTC to drop to the $1,000s, suggesting that it is merely a theory and a point of reference. Vays noted:“I don’t know why people think I am still waiting for $1,200 or $1,500. That is a ridiculous view. People seem to be very confused. And for some reason, people seem to be very upset that when I said Bitcoin has a high probability of going to $1,500, I said it when Bitcoin was here [at a record high].”"
435,"Kevin Chou, CEO and co-founder at blockchain ecosystem Rally, believes that blockchain technology could lead the charge toward a virtual economy in the web 3.0 era.Speaking at Unitize on July 6, Chou, who is also involved with the firms Kabam, Forte and Gen G, said that content platforms should move away from the old business model of web 2.0 that consists of the platforms taking a large portion of the revenue.Instead, companies should create a new and decentralized business model that favors influencers, creators, and “give away the governance to the community,"" said Chou.He added, “The web 2.0 era of business models was very much about how I build a very large platform and give away the service for free but collect a bunch of that data. […] I’m surprised, and there are many great value services that have been created, but we’re also seeing the drawbacks to that today with the lack of privacy, lack of control of your own data, and lack of control over the economics because it’s primarily advertising-based.”“I think a lot of the new blockchain projects and web 3.0 projects are all about how we create something that will eventually be decentralized. I think the space started with everything that needs to be decentralized from the beginning,” Chou concluded.Chou believes that Bitcoin (BTC) “did a great job of pioneering” the discussion about decentralization by making people and businesses aware that decentralization is feasible, adding, “But we also see now that there’s a path established by projects like Compound and Maker, and a lot of other DeFi projects."""
436,"An essential Bitcoin (BTC) metric has hit a new all-time high as miners pledge ever more computing power to securing the network.Data from various resources including Blockchain confirms that on July 6, Bitcoin’s seven-day average hash rate reached a new peak.The achievement follows several weeks of hash rate growth, with the seven-day average at 123.4 EH/s as of Monday.The previous record came in early March, just a week before the Coronavirus-induced crash severely disrupted both network and price activity.Bitcoin 7-day average hash rate 1-year chart. Source: BlockchainHash rate is an estimate of how much computing power miners are devoting to processing Bitcoin transactions. A higher average suggests that miners have more faith in profitability, and their activity in turn strengthens the network.Cointelegraph regularly reports on hash rate changes, along with Bitcoin mining difficulty, which is also on the rise after around a month of stagnation.“I expect it to keep going up from here, maybe slightly less than the dark blue post 2016 line, at ~2-3X/yr,” quant analyst PlanB commented on Monday.Rising fundamentals currently contrast with the relative lack of support for Bitcoin price bulls. As Cointelegraph reported, only a boost for stock markets saved BTC/USD from a third retest of $9,000 support in as many days.Highs of $9,370 were short-lived, with the pair settling nearer $9,250 at press time on Tuesday.Summarizing the situation, Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb highlighted that those levels represent Bitcoin’s 50-day moving average (DMA).“Bitcoin Failed to reclaim that 9300 level last night.  The 50 DMA is again the test for Bitcoin,  sat at ‘support’ on the 9250 level but the previous 2x times this failed in the exact same situation,” he told subscribers of his Telegram trading channel. “S&P 500 futures were down those times too as they are today, so given that I’ve hedged my longs for now.”Bitcoin has shown strong correlation to the S&P 500, with PlanB this week forecasting BTC hitting $190,000 if the index passes 4,000 points.Meanwhile, realized volatility is at lows not seen since November 2018 — just before a huge sell-off sent Bitcoin to lows of $3,100."
437,"A CryptoCompare report published on July 6 has closely analyzed monthly trends in the cryptocurrency exchange market and found that crypto derivatives volumes have begun to taper off after peaking this May. Crypto derivatives volumes dropped 35.7% in June to $393 billion.Historical Monthly Derivatives Volumes. Source: CryptoCompareThe overall trend which was also observed in the spot markets can be partially explained by the lack of volatility currently seen in Bitcoin and the majority of crypto assets within the market. There are a few exceptions like DeFi tokens, which have outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) considerably in the last month.Despite the drop in overall volumes for the derivatives markets, regulated options seem to be gaining popularity. In June, the total volume for Bitcoin options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rose by 41% to reach another all-time monthly high with 8,444 contracts traded. Meanwhile, BTC futures traded on CME decreased by 23% in June which was still the second biggest month in 2020.CME Options and Futures Contract Volumes. Source: CryptoCompareWhile the soaring volumes in the CME are a pleasant sign for those who are patiently awaiting institutionalization as the catalyst which will bring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to new heights, there are other factors pointing to this change. These trends are already observed in funds like GBTC which boast an institutional investor demographic of over 80% and is currently managing $4.1 billion dollars worth of digital assets. Barry Silbert, CEO at GBTC’s Digital Currency Group, tweeted that the fund has recently gone through its biggest raise yet, although no details are yet known.Companies that cater to institutional needs are also jumping on the crypto bandwagon, further cementing this trend. For example, KPMG, one of the UK's big four accounting firms, launched a cryptocurrency management platform called Chain Fusion. In a recent report by the firm, KPMG said:“Institutionalization is the at scale participation in the market by small and large entities within the global financial ecosystem, including banks, broker dealers, exchanges, payment providers, fintechs and service providers.”As institutions continue to hop into Bitcoin, it’s possible that this trend will continue which in turn can bring many advantages to the overall market.Institutional investors require safe, transparent trading venues whereas a number of cryptocurrency exchanges are known for falsified trading volumes, wash trading, and worse. Philip Gradwell, chief economist of Chainalysis, recently said:“If you want to get serious money into crypto, you have got to build up their confidence that there are actually good trading venues […] If you’re an exchange and you have good incentives to report real volume, you may actually get institutional money coming in, but if you don’t have those incentives, they’ll stay away.”The shift from retail to institutional investors, or at least the substantial increase in the engagement of the latter, may be a clear sign to exchanges that they must behave accordingly or be phased out. These improvements may open the doors for the creation of the much-awaited Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) and other instruments which will lure institutional investors into the crypto sector."

The other women who were allegedly targeted are TechWithCatalina and GirlGoneCrypto. Siegel told Cointelegraph that she has been very vocal about underrepresentation of women in the crypto industry. She noted that out of 25 award nominees, she is the only female:“I have been very local about the fact that there is a gender disparity in the cryptocurrency community and people are not happy with that. They have never been happy with talking about feminist values. So what we know is that the people who were removed were me, GirlGoneCrypto <...> and <...> TechWithCatalina.”The latter was the only female nominee for the Binance Spanish Awards. Both women have been known to collaborate with Siegel.It is possible that Instagram users who disagreed with or felt threatened by the calls for inclusion reported the trio to Instagram, either individually or as a unified effort. Once enough users report a user, their account will typically be suspended pending manual review.Nominees for the Binance Influencer Awards were apparently determined by both the community and the Binance team. The community vote carried 60% of the weight with Binance’s team accounting for the remaining 40%.Cointegraph reached out to Binance for comment, but has not received a response in time for publication."
439,"In little more than 10 years, Bitcoin (BTC) grew from a small cypherpunk community to a matter of national security with vast implications for geopolitics.At the Unitize panel titled “From Bitcoin to Fedcoin: The Next Decade of Digital Money,” Meltem Demirors, CSO of CoinShares, and moderated by Andy Bromberg, president of CoinList, actually spent very little time discussing Fedcoin and central bank currencies in general.Instead, they focused heavily on the implications of a changing geopolitical landscape, where Bitcoin is set to play a role in the upcoming war for tech dominance — while at the same time acting as the key to digitally “exit” from governmental control.Demirors noted that a profound change in global power dynamics began to occur in recent years. She described it as an emerging narrative that focuses on the importance of “computing and connectivity in the context of cyber security and national defense.”She cited landmarks of this phenomenon, like Amazon Web Services becoming the largest defense contractor, or how Huawei was charged for allegedly endangering U.S. national security. Meltem believes that this was politically motivated, as the U.S. “has voiced its concerns about letting foreign governments participate in the build out of infrastructure in this country.”Furthermore, semiconductor companies like Intel and TSMC have begun efforts to “onshore” production back to the United States or their respective countries. The same is likely to happen with Bitcoin mining:“So I think five years from now, it would be very likely that 40% of Bitcoin mining, if not more, is on onshore in the United States. It's very likely that governments will view big cryptocurrency networks as part of national security strategy.”Speaking about stablecoins and especially government-issued digital currencies, Demirors believes that they are in a completely different class from Bitcoin:“I think right now what you're seeing is people are co-opting the idea and trying to implement it in different ways. Central bank digital currencies have absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin. They're antithetical.”In her view, saying that these systems are blockchain-based could be part of a deliberate misrepresentation as propaganda “is starting to come into this industry.”But at the same time, both Demirors and Bromberg noted that central bank currencies could be an improvement over the existing fiat infrastructure. She added:“I think that different needs require different tools. At the end of the day, Bitcoin and all of these other cryptocurrencies, digital fiat and these other projects, they're just tools that we're trying to use to solve our problems.”In her view, the problem that Bitcoin solves is that of “monetary system choice.” People who may be dissatisfied with the way the system works have few options to fight back, and while dollar-based coins may solve some problems, they don’t solve issues of “financial censorship, financial control and a fundamental lack of privacy.” Bitcoin is, according to her, “the leading horse” in becoming a form of resistance money.Thus, paradoxically, Bitcoin can be seen as both a matter of national security and a way of escaping it."

This is equivalent to the entire market capitalization for Bitcoin (BTC).Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, or GPIF, decreased in value by almost 11% to 150.63 trillion yen or $1.4 trillion. This was the fund’s steepest quarterly decline since 2008. Dow Jones & BTC. Source: Yahoo Finance.GPIF was not alone in its poor performance, major stock indexes like Dow Jones posted negative numbers. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s performance was almost identical, where its price from January 1 to March 31 fell by approximately the same 11%.Thus, this is not a case where Bitcoin supporters are able to champion Bitcoin’s perceived safe-haven status. On the other hand, had GPIF invested just 0.1% of its assets under management or $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, in the beginning of the first quarter, this would have created extreme buy pressure on the market.  The likely outcome — a massive Bitcoin bull run and positive returns for the crypto portion of the pension fund’s portfolio. Yet, this would have been a highly unlikely scenario. Pension funds are naturally some of the most conservative investors. Buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin — around 208,000 BTC — in a short time span would have been an almost impossible task.Grayscale’s GBTC fund is currently holding 386,659 BTC. "
441,"Jack Mallers, the developer of the Zap Lightning Wallet, announced on Thursday his new app for iPhone, Android and Chrome, which allows users to send and receive Bitcoin (BTC) and Lightning Network payments directly from and to a bank account.Strike, which has now entered the public beta phase, enables interaction with the Bitcoin and Lightning protocols with no wallet, seed, channels, liquidity or white papers, while Know Your Customer protocols are kept to a bare minimum.Mallers wants Bitcoin to reach mainstream adoption. To this end, he created Zap in 2018 — one of the first desktop wallets making the features of the Lightning Network accessible through a user-friendly interface. Furthermore, as Cointelegraph reported, last autumn Mallers announced his intent to develop a platform offering instant debit card Bitcoin purchases via the Lightning Network. Strike is the result of that work and goes some way beyond its original remit.While Strike does let one purchase Bitcoin with a debit card or bank account, it can also be used for remittances and personal payments, micropayments and both online and offline purchases.It also comes with a strike.me social media profile, which lets users accept free payments from anywhere in the world via an online QR code. Payments received are instantly converted into fiat.One of Mallers' key objectives was to meet regulations while reducing KYC and Anti-Money Laundering procedures, saying:“The last thing I want is to introduce a new demographic of users to Bitcoin, only to have them treated as criminals as soon as they download Strike.”Rather than accepting the commonly utilized belt and braces approach, he set about meeting lawyers and educating regulators to work out how much KYC/AML was “good enough.”With the average payment value in the private beta being around $27, there is little need for mass collection of information and identification. Most users of the app will only need to enter a name and phone number.Some states are excluded, and Strike will not initially be available in those regions.Mallers has big plans for the future of Strike. There is reportedly a Strike Visa debit card in the works, along with a rewards program through partnered merchants and referrals for friends and family.Strike has also been working to provide merchants with tools to process contactless payments, and an improved e-commerce system is also being rolled out."

443,"Having learned what it needs from the cryptocurrency space and blockchain, China will aim to rival the U.S. dollar, not Bitcoin (BTC), with its highly-anticipated digital yuan.Matthew Graham, a veteran investment banker in China and the CEO of Beijing-based Sino Global Capital — analyzed what is known so far about the forthcoming digital currency and argued that the Chinese government sees new technologies as a “leapfrog opportunity” to chip away at the dollar’s hegemony.Speaking with Boxmining founder Michael Gu at the Unitize conference on July 6, Graham said that even though it’s extremely difficult for China to internationalize the renminbi:“Swift, CHIPS, Fedwire [...] they’re antiquated, they're expensive, they're slow. It's 2020 and we have transactions that take three days to clear and that are far more expensive than they should be. All of these technologies that underpin much of the USD-centric global economy are really showing their age. So that's a big opportunity [for China].”Beijing uses the acronym DCEP to refer to its forthcoming digital currency electronic payment system and, as Matthew Gu noted, has “borrowed a lot of its technological details from blockchain,” including concepts such as UTXO. Yet DCEP is a far cry from public blockchains such as Bitcoin. It will reportedly be issued by the People’s Bank of China and remain under the central bank’s full control and authority, as with other existing national fiat currencies.  Graham emphasized that “if you're approaching this [DCEP] from a crypto or blockchain framework, I think you're going to really have a hard time understanding what it is and what and why it's so important.” The new technologies integrated into the digital yuan, including those aspects learned from blockchain, are being used to a different end. Gu cited comments from the chairman of the China International Economic Exchange Center, who has previously said:“DCEP can achieve real-time collection of data related to money creation, bookkeeping, etc, providing useful reference for the provision of money and the implementation of monetary policies.”Graham added that for monetary policy, DCEP “could be very useful for implementing negative interest rates.” Moreover, “it opens up a lot of capabilities in terms of AI and machine learning for fraud detection [...] and there’s potential programmability aspects as well.”Contrast this with systems such as  Fedwire, CHIPS, SWIFT — the “plumbing” that underpins much of the global dollar economy. These, as Graham noted, are “thirty, forty, fifty year old technologies, with all the frictions and costs.""“There is a leapfrog opportunity” here, he said. “DCEP’s not about Bitcoin. It's about potentially internationalizing renminbi, at least to some extent.”"
444,"Bitcoin (BTC) begins a new week testing increasingly weak $9,000 support, but what factors could make or break price performance?Cointelegraph Markets takes a look at the main things traders should focus on in Bitcoin for the coming five days. Stock market futures showed a mixed but overall stronger mood going into Monday. Data, notably last week’s better-than-expected United States employment figures, helped to buoy the mood.Stocks continue to rise, with Chinese stocks booming, despite the rapidly increasing spread of coronavirus. China’s FTSE A50 index hit all-time highs on the day.Weighing that issue against economic data is a key balancing act for the market, and its volatility is set to reflect in Bitcoin’s own moves.“As a proxy for risk sentiment in China, this could bode well for crypto,” crypto lender Amber Group forecast.At press time, BTC/USD had just hit $9,200, a level not seen since July 2, having dipped below $9,000 late Sunday. Bitcoin vs. S&P 500 three-month chart. Source: SkewAs Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin’s correlation with macro may yet yield more pain than gain for investors. The curious “recovery” of stocks comes amid mass interventions in the markets by central banks. Last week, charts showing market performance denominated in Bitcoin and gold highlighted just how unstable current conditions really are. Staying on economic factors, Monday’s finance news was dominated by China imposing checks on large transactions.As Bloomberg reported, the pilot program will ultimately affect 70 million people, who will all be required to pre-report transactions worth over 500,000 yuan ($71,000), be they retail or business clients.The issue is bad debt, which has surged in China in the wake of coronavirus and is now causing major headaches for smaller domestic banks.Chinese residents are officially banned from trading Bitcoin, but over-the-counter (OTC) activities remain, with the true size of the underground market a matter of debate.Recently, one mining pool located in China saw its second-biggest outflow in history, leading to suggestions that the BTC may end up in an OTC sell-off.Meanwhile, the debacle over Hong Kong and its new security law has so far failed to impact Bitcoin in the way that last year’s riots did. At the time, Bitcoin as a safe haven narrative took center stage as cash supplies dwindled and the Hong Kong dollar fell precipitously amid the unrest.Having stayed completely static at the last adjustment, Bitcoin network difficulty is once again set for a healthy uptick next week.The difficulty, non-technically, is a representation of miner participation in the Bitcoin network. Its value goes up and down due to factors impacting their activity, including price.Adjustments, which occur every two weeks, are a vital part of Bitcoin’s ability to regulate itself as a system — regardless of price action or otherwise.In around seven days’ time, the difficulty will increase by an estimated 6%, implying demand is in place to make processing Bitcoin transactions more intensive in terms of computing power.The previous adjustment was 0%, a rare occurrence, while before that, difficulty jumped by 15%, its highest single upward move in over two years.Bitcoin 7-day average difficulty six-month chart.

Hash rate has increased by 10% in the past two weeks.Those hoping that a gap in Bitcoin futures markets might drive price performance to a certain level will be disappointed this week.Low volatility over the weekend means that the difference between last week’s trading close and this week’s open is almost nonexistent — just $20.Bitcoin has a tendency to “fill” gaps left in futures quickly. As Cointelegraph reported, it was only a matter of days before even a giant $1,000 void was canceled out by gains earlier this year. For the coming week, however, the $20 gap at $9,100 is already filled. CME Bitcoin futures 30-minute chart with gaps. Source: TradingViewOverall, however, derivatives markets form an increasingly important focus for Bitcoin analysts, given that they are responsible for the lion’s share of the trading volume. Last week, Cointelegraph discussed what time of day traders are most active.For the short term, Cointelegraph Markets analysts believe that the most important thing for Bitcoin is to hold not even $9,000, but lower.In a summary late last week, Michaël van de Poppe explained that $8,600 was the target to protect, and failure to do so would trigger a “heavy breakdown.”Similarly, there is potential for a breakout above $10,500, itself a key resistance level. It all depends on volume, says Van de Poppe.“During the range-bound period of 2019, the volume drained away over time. The actual climax of the volume came with the breakout, which meant that breakout traders hit their limit buys and shorters hit their stop/loss,” he wrote, comparing the 2019 bull run and current conditions.“This chain reaction triggered a sudden $1,000 candle.”Volume dips have accompanied the return of lower exchange reserves as traders appear primed to hold and not sell for the near term."

The graphic flawlessly describes how each group's psychological profile reflects on consumer habits and how they approach innovative products and services. One of the most important areas to note is the clear breaking point known as ""the chasm.""This gap between early adopters and the early majority exists because consumers prefer to listen and copy references from their group. This leap represents the transition to a mainstream market and bears many similarities to the current life cycle of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, crossing the chasm is of utter importance for any product or service willing to serve a more pragmatism client base.Geoffrey Moore's book Crossing the Chasm states that to surpass the void, the product should offer a complete solution, provide a high service level to entice pragmatists and establish a strong word-of-mouth reputation.Global smartphone sales (millions).

Source: TradingViewBitcoin and S&P 500 90-day correlation. Source: TradingViewAlthough Bitcoin can be deemed an innovative technology with indisputable advantages over traditional financial instruments and gold itself, it has yet to prove its trillion-dollar potential. Changing human patterns and, more importantly, beliefs is a Herculean task. The definition of money has been deeply engraved in society by fiat systems that are dependent on intermediaries. Furthermore, ""money"" is frequently subject to the erratic control of governments and central banks. Bitcoin may undergo a metamorphosis of sorts to reach an early majority of pragmatists.The June 2010 launch of the iPhone 4 finally set the spark for these pragmatists. Was it the 5-megapixel camera with 720p resolution? Could it have been the FaceTime launch? Perhaps it was the App Store reaching 5 billion downloads or the reduced $99 two-year contract for the old 3GS model? It’s possible that it was a combination of each of these product offerings and milestones that allowed Apple to bypass the chasm.It is a fruitless exercise to imagine what it will take to shift an entire niche of participants who are already aware of Bitcoin’s benefits but so far remain unmoved.Minor adoption catalysts for merchants and investors have already been put in place. For example, BitPay and Coinbase Commerce, but there is still plenty of room for improvement.Apple investors who fled in 2008 due to stock price volatility, 20% drops in value, or the mainstream adoption uncertainties that lay ahead are likely quite regretful now. This is because AAPL shares skyrocketed 520% over the next three years to reach $78 in early 2012.A similar growth outcome for Bitcoin would drive its price to $59,900, amounting to a $1.1 trillion market capitalization in 2023. Of course, to many, that sounds incredibly unreasonable.A potential trillion-dollar valuation for Bitcoin represents only 10% of gold's $11 trillion total market capitalization. Although it might seem like an impossible figure, it is a mere 3% of the current global supply of banknotes, coins and checking deposits.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.It has been a sleepy week in the crypto markets — and there’s barely been any movement in Bitcoin. At the time of writing, BTC is down 0.75% compared with where it was seven days ago. Traders were braced for a big drop this week after Bitcoin dipped below $9,000 for the seventh time in two months. Cointelegraph analyst Michaël van de Poppe says BTC is consolidating below $9,300, but this isn’t necessarily bearish as a major breakout may be in the works. He’s warned support must hold at $8,900–$9,000 to prevent a further drop into bearish territory — and a key resistance level at $9,300 must be broken. All eyes are on the equities markets amid fears that a nasty downturn here could drag BTC down with it.

But not everyone subscribes to this theory. OKCoin chief operating officer Jason Lau believes any PayPal foray into digital assets would be “sure to have a positive impact in highlighting cryptocurrencies to a big new audience,” telling Cointelegraph: “PayPal adding crypto would bring additional awareness, adoption and a new low friction payment method for individual users.” Lau explained that many crypto users often get involved through mainstream, user-friendly and simple avenues at first. The OKCoin executive added: “Typically, our users first get initiated to crypto via an app like Square Cash, Robinhood or now potentially Venmo, and then come to OKCoin to develop and execute their investing and trading plans.”Police forces across Europe have “successfully penetrated” an encrypted chat network that suspected top-tier criminals used to ferry drugs and import guns.

Awareness of the industry also appears to be on the rise… 73% of adults have heard of cryptocurrencies, compared with 42% last year.

Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow believes EvilQuest is unlikely to be anything other than a small-scale threat, telling Cointelegraph: “The fact that Macs have a relatively small market share means they’re not a particularly attractive target for ransomware groups, and they’re unlikely to invest significant resources in targeting Mac users.”A Russian court has effectively declared that Bitcoin theft is not a crime. Back in 2018, two men impersonating FSB agents kidnapped someone and forced him into giving them 5 million rubles ($90,000) in cash and 99.7 BTC — worth about $900,000 at the time. The kidnappers were sentenced to eight and ten-year prison sentences, respectively — and as part of the criminal proceedings, the victim asked the court for the thieves to repay the funds they stole from him. Although the court said the criminals must repay the rubles, it declared it is unable to satisfy the claim for the BTC because cryptocurrencies aren’t recognized by Russia’s laws as legal tender.Prominent angel investor and internet entrepreneur Jason Calacanis says 99% of altcoin projects are “garbage” run by unqualified individuals but holds out hope for the 1% with the power to change the world.

Those BTC could have been acquired earlier by professional investors or borrowed from large over-the-counter trading desks.For example, Genesis, a leading OTC and lending firm, closed the fourth quarter of 2019 with $545 million worth of active loans, as reported by Cointelegraph.Although there’s clearly a final buyer for these GBTC shares, it can’t be said that this flow is adding buying pressure to the market.Effectively, BTC are moving out of professional clients’ hands to Grayscale Investments as a custodian. This is a regular trade, similar to the $82 billion trading volume seen in the last 30 days on regular exchanges.The Bloomberg report also cites growing CME Bitcoin futures open interest as a signal of asset maturation and a positive price indicator. This misses the mark in so many ways as Medallion Funds recent $10 billion entry in this market definitively can’t be pegged to long-term investment or even some fundamental bullish case.Such quantitative arbitrage trading desks make both long and short trades, so it is impossible to correlate such increasing activity with either bull or bearish cases.Not to mention, CME Bitcoin futures are financially liquidated instruments, meaning no actual BTC is moved on contract expiry.To conclude, the Bloomberg report indicates that futures trading on a U.S. regulated exchange is vital for mainstream adoption. Even if one considers BAKKT physical futures with BTC settlement, the BTC in their custody are not accepted as margin.Mainstream adoption has nothing to do with derivatives trading as Bitcoin has been designed to work independently, without the need of ETF and financial instruments.In fact, mainstream adoption is more likely to happen when major investment funds create direct exposure to Bitcoin.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

449,"Institutional interest in digital assets has been growing. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s volume of Bitcoin (BTC) options hit a high of $40 million on May 13, 2020. The world’s largest digital currency asset manager, Grayscale, posted record-breaking capital inflow to its GBTC fund in Q1 2020, and Fidelity’s cryptocurrency services division confirmed increased interest from pension funds and family offices.Due to growing interest from financial institutions examining how to leverage blockchain technology for security issuance, industry and regulators alike have turned their attention to assigning International Securities Identification Numbers for digital assets. This standardization is necessary in order for firms to ensure consistency, gain efficiencies, increase transparency and lower costs.An industry body, responsible for the adoption and implementation of international standards for identifying financial and referential instruments, is in the process of examining a number of various scenarios, in which digital assets could require the assignment of ISINs. Typically, the umbrella term of “digital assets” is broken down into three different use cases — incorporating security tokens, payment tokens and utility tokens. The focus of these particular discussions has been around security tokens because the scope of financial and referential instruments overlaps most with the current remit of the ISIN standard.Specifically, those participating are in the process of evaluating the following key points:Whether there is a need for an ISIN with regards to different but complementary standards, such as the Digital Token Identifier currently being developed by the International Organisation of Standardisation Working Group 3 (ISO/TC 68/SC 8/WG 3).What the different scenarios are, in which an ISIN in relation to a digital asset could be issued, including: (1) straightforward security (e.g., a plain vanilla bond) issued via distributed ledger technology; (2) security with an underlying referential instrument, which is a digital asset (e.g., an ETF that tracks Bitcoin); and (3) a digital asset that is used as an underlying referential instrument (e.g., Bitcoin) — thus raising the question of whether an ISIN should be applicable to a referential instrument.How different regulatory regimes treat each of the different scenarios listed above in terms of both existing and forthcoming regulations.Those involved in the discussions represent a cross-section of the financial industry and have come together under the auspices of the Association of National Numbering Agencies, whose overarching goal is to support a transparent, compliant and efficient financial markets structure. The outcome of these examinations will be used to build the rationale for recommendations on the assignment of ISINs within each scenario, using a technology-agnostic approach.While digital assets are currently only a fraction of the traditional space within the financial services industry, this work is considered significant, given that new asset classes have a tendency to evolve quite quickly. Stakeholders in traditional financial markets benefit from the provision of international standards to identify, classify and describe financial and referential instruments that help in the process of providing accurate and reliable data for suitable investment and trading decisions. Similarly, participants in the digital token ecosystem will need accurate, reliable and quality data attributes to make appropriate investment and trading decisions.Now is the time, therefore, to prepare the groundwork in order to ensure consistency and uniformity of the data around these digital assets. The outcome of these industry discussions will be an important part of the journey to provide tools that will be most useful to the industry as a whole.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Stephan Dreyer has been managing director of the Association of National Numbering Agencies since Jan. 2, 2020.

450,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $9,000 for a total of eight times in the past two months. Yet, it has recovered with strength after every pullback.According to a pseudonymous crypto analyst, Bitcoin could sustain its uptrend if it reclaims the 200-day displaced moving average (DMA). The analyst, known as CryptoKea, said:“BTC broke the lower band of the bullish channel a few days ago. Is the bullish uptrend at jeopardy? Imho, as long as price recovers back above 1.1x the 200 DMA soon (currently at $9,234 and rising), bull trend should stay intact.”The DMA is a moving average that is typically used in technical analysis to spot the trend direction and potential reversals.The price trend of Bitcoin with 200-day DMA. Source: CryptoKeaSince May 13, the $9,200 level has acted as a strong area of support for Bitcoin. Although BTC dropped to as low as $8,600 in late May, it swiftly recovered back to $9,200.In the short-term, there are two levels that might define the future trend of Bitcoin: $9,000 and $9,200. If both levels remain intact, there is a possibility that BTC recovers and sees a newfound uptrend.But if $9,000 and $9,200 are confirmed as resistance levels, traders anticipate a correction in the third quarter.The price of Bitcoin can drop below support levels and still reclaim its momentum if it quickly recovers. For example, in the first week of May, the price of Bitcoin was hovering at $9,000. It was trading above the 200-day DMA, above $8,800.Eventually, as the price of Bitcoin stayed on top of the pivotal DMA, it rallied to as high as $10,440. BTC rejected at a key multi-year resistance level, but it saw a strong near-term rally.The analyst said at the time:“BTC is holding steady above 1.1x the 200 DMA, which is the support line of the bullish channel (yellow). If price is ready for a sustained, bullish uptrend and history were to repeat, price could remain in this channel for >1 yr, current range: $8.8k-$13.6k.”Similarly, there are two potential scenarios for Bitcoin in the upcoming weeks. First, Bitcoin moves back above $9,234 and initiates an upward movement to $9,500 and $9,900. Second, Bitcoin clearly rejects $9,200 and $9,000, confirming both as resistance levels as it drops to the $8,000s.The daily chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comBoth scenarios are still highly probable, especially considering that volume is low during the weekend. The price of Bitcoin dropped below $9,000 briefly on July 5, but the low volume makes BTC vulnerable to unexpected price spikes or pullbacks.One variable might sway the price trend of Bitcoin in the near-term to sway towards a correction. That is the repeated break below $9,000 in the past week. When a crucial support area gets broken many times over, the level weakens and raises the probability of a downtrend."
451,"The news that PayPal, the payments giant with 325 million active user accounts worldwide, was considering the direct sale of crypto assets — along with custodial services — had the crypto community buzzing last week, even if the reports couldn’t be verified. On July 1, a PayPal representative told Cointelegraph: “PayPal does not comment on rumors or speculation.”Guy Hirsch, the United States managing director of eToro, told Cointelegraph: “The importance of a global company like PayPal and Venmo getting into crypto is profound.” It will change the nature of cross-border transactions, which are now expensive and slow. Moreover, Hirsch added: “We’ll see more companies following the footsteps of Facebook, and now PayPal, to leverage crypto for cross-border payments, settlement and other use cases needed to optimize for a global economy.”Sidharth Sogani, the founder and CEO of research firm Crebaco, told Cointelegraph: “The future of payments is in cryptocurrencies and P2P transaction settlements. Whether you like it or not, it’s here to stay,” adding: “PayPal has been the leader in simplifying online payments, and that’s the reason it recognizes the simplicity and capability of cryptocurrencies.”So, does this mean that large traditional enterprises are now ready to embrace crypto payments? Maybe not, at least according to two recent research reports.In a May 2020 report that was shared with Cointelegraph, Gartner, a research and advisory firm, warned the chief information officers of large companies to be “very careful toward claims that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could succeed as a medium of exchange,” adding:“For all the promise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, none of the largest online or traditional retailers accept them at scale. While bitcoin is used as a store of value, it has not become a medium of exchange for day-to-day commercial exchanges.”The study questioned whether blockchain-based payments would really reduce fees to the extent claimed. In addition, “there is a lack of clarity around accounting and tax treatments, and most merchants are not able to handle the cryptocurrency exchange risks.”A recent Credit Suisse report, meanwhile, predicted that “cryptocurrencies will be challenged to make a meaningful impact on the existing consumer payments (C2B) ecosystem over the near to medium term.” Problems cited were taxation issues, regulatory uncertainty and “lack of chargeback and dispute processes.”Others agree that challenges remain. Nick Saponaro, a co-founder and the chief information officer of The Divi Project — a masternode solution — told Cointelegraph: “We need more solutions that facilitate B2B payments and invoicing before we see corporations adopting en masse.” In the U.S., the current tax treatment of cryptocurrencies makes them unattractive as a medium of commercial exchange. “You don’t have to pay capital gains on fiat accepted at your point of sale, and you shouldn’t have to do so with Bitcoin. For now, however, you do,” he said.These obstacles can be overcome, though, according to Hirsch: “While there are local issues in every jurisdiction with taxes, regulations and risk management, the benefits outweigh the downsides.”The allure of secure, frictionless, low-fee payment transactions remains. Gil Hildebrand, the CEO of Gilded — a financial services provider — told Cointelegraph that while the internet makes it easy to contact people: “Paying them and getting paid from them is still incredibly fragmented and inefficient. Crypto removes middlemen and makes payments cheaper, faster and more global.”On the other hand, Saponaro said: “There are several large organizations accepting crypto as payment from customers,” enabling people to pay their phone bills and even taxes in some U.S. states. Bill Zielke, the chief marketing officer of BitPay — a Bitcoin payment-acquiring processor — told Cointelegraph: “We are seeing increased demand for crypto payment services.” According to him, transactions on BitPay were up 7.2% in Q1 2020 compared to Q4 2019, while volume increased 9.1% over the same period.Among nonprofit organizations that are now accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptos are the American Cancer Society, Score and CARE. GlobeAir, a large jet charter firm in Europe, recently became the first private jet charter operator to accept Bitcoin payments. The NBA’s Dallas Mavericks accept Bitcoin as an alternative payment method for both game tickets and merchandise, as well as online electronics retailer Newegg, which operates in 72 countries.Still, some of the blockchain-based programs haven’t exactly panned out, according to Gartner’s report. The firm suggested that some companies have been motivated more by corporate public relations than a real desire to tackle inefficiencies. In May 2019, for instance, AT&T announced that it had selected BitPay as a bill payment option for its customers. Gartner’s report stated:“Notwithstanding an announcement short on details and the lack of an update on the usage level one year later, AT&T is not the first company making such a move, notably to benefit from PR on how innovative it is, and at the relatively low cost of consuming an API. But, the track record so far is not positive, as detailed in an article exploring Burger King’s use and acceptance of cryptocurrencies at some of its stores.”There are still hundreds of multinational organizations that don’t accept crypto as payment, added Saponaro. “I believe this is due to the dichotomy between consumer and corporation, as it specifically pertains to this asset class. Users either don’t understand it or are using coins that are ‘unspendable.’”This chasm can be bridged, however, in Saponaro’s view, as hybrid finance ecosystems continue to evolve: “Benefits become more evident to users, and the fiat and crypto services become more consolidated. They will start using crypto more.” However, according to Hildebrand: “The main issues for businesses in 2020 are custody and liquidity,” he told Cointelegraph, adding:“A crypto wallet needs to feel as safe, secure and functional as a bank account in order for businesses to trust it. There should be approvals, so no one person in the organization can go rogue. There should be a phone number they can call with support questions. And there should be bulletproof recovery features, in case private keys get lost.”Liquidity also becomes key because it determines whether crypto transactions become too costly and/or slow. As Hildebrand explained, buying BTC on a U.S. exchange may entail a 1% fee paid to a vendor in Singapore. That vendor will then withdraw funds into their local fiat currency for yet another 1% fee. This would make the whole process just as expensive as a credit card payment and would require several days due to bank deposit/withdrawal lag.The lack of merchant awareness of accepting crypto payments as a business benefit is the largest obstacle to adoption, said Zielke. “Many merchants are unaware of the massive size and value of crypto users. With a market capitalization more than $200 billion, the crypto market is a massive possible customer base to merchants.” Purchases made with Bitcoin are, on average, two to two and a half times higher than credit cards, with many of these customers being new, according to Zielke.Eventually, some large corporations might even pay their employees in crypto, suggested Sogani: “Companies with international employees spend up to 3% to settle salaries every month. This can be reduced to just a few dollars [per employee] if Bitcoin is used.” Moreover, employees will receive payments faster — “it will be settled in less than one hour.”Talking of PayPal specifically, Sogani added that the sale of crypto assets will be a simple integration, “as it will be more of an exchange+wallet service which they will provide.” The new PayPal/Venmo entity will emerge as a direct competitor to crypto-focused companies like CoinBase, he predicted.Still, what about price volatility, which has long been a source of woes for proponents of crypto-based payment systems? Aibek Amandanov, the head of global marketing and big data at HUPAYX — a payment solution — told Cointelegraph that price volatility is indeed a big issue, adding that “large companies know that well and steer away from it.” So, can one expect widespread acceptance of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) in the payments process, or must corporate acceptance inevitably involve stablecoins?Hildebrand voiced the opinion that “BTC is still king of crypto payments,” adding: “However, stablecoins resolve many of the issues around volatility and taxes that prevent businesses from being able to adopt it.” Within the next two years, stablecoins will overtake Bitcoin as the primary form of crypto payments, he opined, particularly with improvements in user experience and resolution of many regulatory issues.Sogani added: “When there are more users of Bitcoin, who accept and pay in Bitcoin or any other currency for that matter, the volatility aspect will soon disappear.” That may still take some years, though, and in the meantime, he expects to see more use of SegWit and the Lightning Network. Meanwhile, according to Zielke, stablecoins have been gaining traction, especially for cross border transactions, but all Bitcoin alternatives — including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), ETH, USD Coin (USDC) — still account for only 8% of BitPay’s transaction numbers.One shouldn’t overlook demographics, either. Crypto-exchanges’ largest customer base is individuals between 22 and 34 years of age, according to Gartner’s report, and they “tend to have a stronger need to deal with urgent payments due to their life stage, and they attach a greater weight to any solution saving time and improving their monetary liquidity.”All in all, PayPal/Venmo, with over 325 million active users, dwarfs anything seen so far in the crypto space, excluding Facebook’s Libra stablecoin, which has yet to roll out. Binance, the world’s largest crypto-exchange, has only 15 million users, by comparison. Therefore, a PayPal entrance is bound to shake the ground underneath the crypto industry — even as questions about price volatility and tax treatment continue to dog the crypto sector. Hirsch from eToro provided an insight into how such a service may ultimately operate:“A customer in one country could buy crypto using their local currency, send it via PayPal wallet, settle on the blockchain, then redeemed to the local currency in the country where the recipient is residing. All with the backing and security of a company like PayPal, which can introduce millions of people around the world to the benefits of crypto.”"
452,"Bitcoin (BTC) has failed to challenge the multi-year resistance of $10,500 since the beginning of June 2020. This extended period of chop will ultimately result in one of two inevitable outcomes.  Either a massive green candle to catch bears off guard or a period of profit-taking that will see the leading digital crypto-asset fall to sub $8K levels in the coming weeks.  But what signs can we look out for to determine which direction the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization will go?   Daily crypto market performance. Source: Coin360.comUsing the Moving Average Divergence Convergence (MACD) indicator, which on the weekly chart has historically proven to be an incredibly accurate indicator for buying and selling Bitcoin, you can see that the blue MACD line is starting to point down toward the orange signal line. Whenever the weekly MACD does this, it signals to investors and traders to either sell or short. In the early history of Bitcoin, both bullish MACD crosses (when the blue MACD line crosses up through the orange signal line) and bearish MACD crosses (what we’re seeing now) were infrequent — they would occur once a year maybe twice.  BTC/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingView However, in the last 18 months, they crossed nine times, that’s once every two months on average since the beginning of the 2018 bear market. The last time Bitcoin crossed bearish on the MACD there was a whopping 57% decline in the price of Bitcoin almost immediately after they crossed. So are we in store for yet another pullback? According to the Fibonacci levels, this could put downside targets anywhere between $7,916 and $3,850.   BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView On the daily chart, things are not much clearer. It’s evident from the chart that $10,400 is the resistance and $8,800 is the support. How long this range continues is anyone's guess. However, the last time Bitcoin broke through this level, the price soared by a further 32.2%, at which point $10,400 became support several times before eventually continuing its downtrend.  Right now, Bitcoin is dangerously close to the support level, which happens to be the 236 Fib.  Losing this level opens up $7,900 as the first downside target.  Conversely, should the bulls take control and push past the $10,400 resistance level, the upside from the current price of $9,040 is a staggering 56%. Quite the trade if you can pull it off, but one that first needs to wait for confirmation, and this could take not weeks, but months to play out.   BTC/USD 1-hour RSI chart Source: TradingViewOn a more positive note, the 1-hour relative strength index (RSI) indicator shows that buyers stepped in as it approached oversold territory around 31.40.  Keep in mind, that anything below 30 is considered a strong buy signal.  However, on the higher time frames between the 12h and monthly charts, the RSI is very much in the middle, providing no clue as to which way the market is going to go. Either the bulls will take charge and push up BTC price 50% or the bears will drive the price down by an equal percentage. There is quite literally nothing on the charts that can give an indication with the exception of the bearish MACD. However, sideways action can cause the MACD to cross if it lasts long enough. ASIC producers’ market share. Source: BitMEXIn a recent report published on the Bitmex Blog entitled “Battle for Asic Supremacy,” you can see that the previous leaders in ASIC production such as Bitmain are losing their dominance. Having once occupied a 75% market share, new stars like MicroBT are fast becoming the new dominant force in this space.  But with mining rewards recently being halved, this particular industry looks somewhat like a financial black hole. For example, Canaan’s share prices tanked by nearly 50% shortly after a $90m IPO last year, and relative newcomers Ebang are seemingly desperate for cash after having their Hong Kong IPO rejected in 2018. Now, these firms are seeking a cash injection on United States’ soil after recently filing for a U.S.-based IPO in April 2020.  The unsurprising lack of financial interest in these companies will almost certainly be playing a role in the current price of Bitcoin.  The question this leaves me with is this: “if no one is making any money from Bitcoin, what happens next?” Is this a bullish or bearish thing? To me, the answer seems obvious, it comes across as very bearish.BTC/USD 1-hour chart Source: TradingViewUsing the current Fib levels on the hourly chart, the key levels to claim are the 618 at $9,420 and the 100% at $9,800.  After $9,800, the last area of heavy resistance sits at $10,400. Using the same chart and Fib levels, $8,800 is where the first level of support will be found.  Losing this level at this stage of the game would open up the 382 on the daily chart, which sits around $7,600.

We asked him to explain why his patent might have presented an obstacle to Hal Finney and other cypherpunks in their ambition of creating a decentralized currency, considering that his patent involves an intermediary.Okamoto kindly prepared diagrams elucidating the differences between the ecash system outlined in his patent and Bitcoin (BTC).Diagram: Electronic Cash described in Patent 49775595. Source: NTT ResearchDiagram: Bitcoin. Source: NTT ResearchBoth solutions use public keys as pseudonymous identities and private keys to authorize transactions. However, in Okamoto’s proposal, a trusted party varies transactions, whereas Bitcoin is trustless, with all nodes verifying transactions.Considering this key difference, one might ponder — why Finney and other pioneers were so paranoid about patent infringement? One obvious answer is that Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin proposal was the first successful framework for a trustless electronic cash system. Coming up with it was not a trivial achievement; almost 30 years passed between the introduction of Chaum’s DigiCash and Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.Many believe Finney to be Satoshi Nakamoto or at least part of the team that was behind the moniker. Besides his interests, expertise and early Bitcoin involvement, another fact strongly supports this theory — being a neighbor of Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. Considering that Google cannot return a single query for Satoshi Nakamoto before the Bitcoin proposal was publicized, this coincidence is eerie. If Finney, indeed was behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, his familiarity with the works of Tatsuaki Okamoto might have also played a role in the choice of the alias.Okamoto told Cointelegraph that he was never a part of the famous cryptographic mailing lists and did not know Hal Finney personally."
454,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC), the top-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been ranging between $8,600 and $10,500 since the halving. During the two-months’ sideways action, the market started to heat up and altcoins entered the spotlight.Additionally, traders and investors are constantly debating whether BTC price is still in bull or bear territory. Let’s take a closer look at the charts to where Bitcoin may be headed next.Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360The price of Bitcoin has a critical level to sustain above at the $8,550-8,750 area.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin has been in a significant uptrend since the heavy crash in March. As an uptrend is classified through higher highs and higher lows, the recent low is found at the $8,550-8,750 area.This is a significant area because traders use these pivots for the placement of stop/loss levels. But since the price of Bitcoin has been slowly retracing and consolidating, the focus should be on the volume.During the consolidation period, the volume steadily decreased. This is an indication that we’re not in the “move,” which would mean a new trend. This move would be confirmed by a heavy breakout above $10,500 or a heavy breakdown below $8,500.An example is seen in the consolidation period around $3,500-4,000 eighteen months ago.In the first quarter of 2019, the price of Bitcoin moved inside a narrow range.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThis is significant because it shows what usually happens during a lengthy sideways period and why the current stage is also classified as one.During the range-bound period of 2019, the volume drained away over time. The actual climax of the volume came with the breakout, which meant that breakout traders hit their limit buys and shorters hit their stop/loss.This chain reaction triggered a sudden $1,000 candle. As the price has been hovering in the range for months, the breakout is usually a significant and explosive one. The longer something ranges in a certain accumulation period, the bigger the move once it breaks out.This exact example can be seen with many altcoins as some of them have been hovering in an accumulation range. One such example is Zilliqa (ZIL), which broke out of the range and surged for 1,000% since.The crucial levels on smaller timeframes are essentially the support between $8,800-9,000 and the resistance at $9,300. The latter is more important as a breakthrough of the $9,300 level would signal further upward continuation. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart is showing a clear range-bound structure. Support is found between $8,900-9,000, which must hold for the bulls. As long as that support remains support, a retest of the resistance zone is on the table.Generally, the more often a level gets tested, the weaker it becomes. Therefore, a renewed test of resistance at the $9,300 level could lead to a significant breakout as it would place Bitcoin back inside the previous range.In other words, the chances of further downside get slimmer if $9,300 is reclaimed.Total market capitalization cryptocurrency 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is holding the previous low as support as well.More significantly, the total cryptocurrency market cap is holding above the 100-day and 200-day Moving Averages (MA). As long as these hold, the market capitalization is in bull territory.This is because this is a significant bull/bear momentum indicator. The 100-day and 200-Day MAs have been serving as support throughout the entire previous cryptocurrency market cycle.With these levels likely holding as support, a breakout above $260 billion becomes increasingly likely. Reclaiming the $260 billion level would also add fuel for further momentum toward new highs.BTC/USD 4-hour bullish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bullish scenario has a few crucial points. First of all, the support at $8,900-9,000 has to hold. If this support is lost, BTC/USD will likely drop below $8,550-8,750 into bearish territory.Second, the key resistance at $9,300 has to break for a potential rally toward $9,650. Since this level is untested, it would be the first pivot point for more upside. This previous resistance of $9,300 has to flip for support for a move higher.However, as long as the price of Bitcoin remains below $10,500, it’s expected that the volume of the move will be small. A big breakout would occur if the resistance zone of $10,000-10,500 is finally conquered as many triggers would be hit.It wouldn’t be a surprise to see a quick rise within a few hours to the next major resistance zone at $11,600.BTC/USD 4-hour bearish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bearish scenario is also heavily dependent on the $9,300 level. If that level rejects again, a retest of support at $8,800-8,900 should be expected and the weaker this support will become, increasing the chances for more downside.With $9,300 holding as resistance, a retest of $8,800-8,900 would likely result in another drop. Going below the $8,600 level could also see a high-volume drop because this means that the range of the past two months would be lost.If the price of Bitcoin drops below $8,600, I’m expecting a fast drop towards $7,400-7,700 without many opportunities for shorts. Holding the current support and the 1-day support levels would mean that the market is still in great shape.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

455,"In addition to the obvious advantages in the form of anonymity, accessibility, ease of use and low cost of transactions, cryptocurrencies have some serious drawbacks that impede their global adoption. The main one is the connection between crypto and crime. Everyone who has studied this topic even superficially knows that Bitcoin (BTC) still remains a popular payment method among scammers and criminals on the darknet. Cryptocurrencies are very convenient tools for money laundering, evading taxes and cheating investors. Today, I will talk about the most famous cryptocurrency pyramids, from which millions of investors suffered and whose activities amounted to billions of dollars in losses. These companies worked on Ponzi schemes, named after an Italian fraudster of the early 20th century. These pyramids do not produce goods and do not provide services — all they do is network marketing, where each member of the pyramid invites several new ones that invite the next ones and so on.The only people involved who manage to earn in such a system are the organizers and some early investors who managed to withdraw their money in time. The remaining participants in the pyramid are left without money, with debts, or in the case of cryptocurrency pyramids, with no valuable tokens.OneCoin is considered one of the largest cryptocurrency pyramids, which functioned from 2014 to 2017, deceiving about three million people and defrauding investors of around $5 billion in total. The founder of One Coin is the Bulgarian fraudster Ruzha Ignatova. The pyramid worked according to the classical Ponzi scheme, in which participants receive a reward for each new person invited.The scammer convinced her audience that OneCoin would soon become the most influential cryptocurrency in the world. There were even promises to “kill Bitcoin.” It is worth noting that her coin did not even have its own blockchain and was accepted only on sites associated with the pyramid. For the first time, the Bulgarian government spoke about the threat from fraudsters by publishing a message about the risks of participating in OneCoin, since the project is not a financial instrument and is not controlled by regulators. This caused the pyramid to “leave” the country and refuse to work with Bulgarian banks.But soon, criticism and warnings about participating in the scheme came from the United Kingdom, Austria and Thailand. Italy and Germany even banned the activities of OneCoin in the countries and blocked their accounts. Ignatova simply did not attend the next announced meeting with investors in Lisbon, and was never seen again. There is no information on her whereabouts.The United States government has charged Ruzha Ignatova with fraud and money laundering. While she faces 25 years of imprisonment, law enforcement officers still managed to arrest some of her accomplices, among whom include her lawyer, brother and former business partner.Another major crypto pyramid functioned from 2016 to 2018: BitConnect. It was created by unknown developers and led by a man named Satao Nakamoto.Participants had to buy BCC tokens and lock them on a special platform, and the trading bot had to earn profit automatically. Members of the pyramid were promised 40% in profit per month. According to the organizers of BitConnect, from an initial investment of $1,000, investors could expect to withdraw $50 million in three years’ time.The first critic of the pyramid was Vitalik Buterin, who drew attention to the fact that the promise of 1% profit per day is a classic Ponzi scheme. After some time, Mike Novogratz and Litecoin (LTC) creator Charlie Lee agreed with the opinion of the founder of Ethereum. At the same time, questions for the organizers of BitConnect came from the United Kingdom government, which demanded the company to reveal its business model. Yet, this did not prevent fraudsters from participating in crypto events and attracting new investors.The U.S. authorities helped to end this story, calling BitConnect a financial pyramid and demanding that it cease operations. After that, the BCC token fell by 90%, investors were left with a total loss of $3.5 billion, and one of the organizers of the pyramid was behind bars. Divayesh Darji, the head of the Indian branch of BitConnect, did, however, come out on bail in 2019.Related: From Bitconnect to SIM-Swap Swindling: 2018's Biggest ScamsThe youngest and largest financial pyramid in recent years. Founded in 2018, the pyramid was advertised in Chinese WeChat with promises of 10%–30% of return on investment per month. Around four million people became participants in the PlusToken ponzi scheme. Fraudsters allegedly advocated financial literacy and trained people to use cryptocurrencies, but ultimately aimed to convert them to Plus tokens. In this case, justice still overtook the organizers of the scheme, and a year ago, six of them were arrested at the request of Chinese authorities. However, the $3 billion lost by investors could not be returned, and remains with the PlusToken team members. More recently, on June 22, all EOS was withdrawn from the pyramid’s wallets, and soon enough, this was repeated with all ETH tokens.Despite the fact that these pyramids have practically ceased their activity, their various “reincarnations” constantly appear, attracting inexperienced investors. The government cannot forever protect citizens from such schemes, since prohibition requires proof of a crime. In this case, the best defense is knowledge. If everyone could recognize the huge profit margins promised by companies in exchange for investment as a red flag rather than a gold mine, there would be significantly fewer fraudsters.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Nick Bel is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and tech writer based in London.

456,"As interconnectivity turns the world into a global village, cyberattacks are expectedly on the rise. According to reports, the tail end of last year saw a spike in the average amount of payments made to ransomware attackers, as several organizations were forced to pay millions of dollars to have their files released by malware attackers.Apart from the fact that the current pandemic has left many individuals and corporations vulnerable to attacks, the notion that cryptocurrencies are an anonymous and untraceable payment method has led many ransomware attackers to demand payment in Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins. Just recently, a report published on June 23 by cybersecurity firm Fox-IT revealed a malware group named Evil Corp that has been on a rampage with new ransomware that demands its victims to pay a million dollars in Bitcoin.The report also reveals that groups such as Evil Corp create ransomware that targets database services, cloud environments and file servers intending to disable or disrupt backup applications of a company’s infrastructure. On June 28, cybersecurity firm Symantec reported blocking a ransomware attack by Evil Corp that targeted about 30 United States firms demanding Bitcoin in payment.These attempted attacks are just the most recent examples of the escalating threat of ransomware attacks. Below are some of the most malicious ransomware demanding payment in crypto.WastedLocker is the latest ransomware created by Evil Corp, a group that has been active since 2007 and is regarded as one of the most lethal cybercrime teams. After the indictment of two alleged members of the group, Igor Turashev and Maksim Yakubets, in connection to the Bugat/Dridex and Zeus banking trojans, Evil Corp reportedly reduced its activity.However, researchers now believe that as of May 2020, the group has resumed attacks once again, with the WastedLocker malware as its latest creation. The malware has been named “WastedLocker” due to the filename created by the malware, which adds an abbreviation of the victim’s name to the word “wasted.”By disabling and disrupting backup applications, database services and cloud environments, WastedLocker prevents its victims’ ability to recover their files for a longer period of time, even if there is an offline backup setup. In cases where a company lacks offline backup systems, recovery can be prevented indefinitely. Researchers, however, note that unlike other ransomware operators that leak victim’s information, Evil Corp has not threatened to publish victims’ information in order to avoid attracting public attention to itself.DoppelPaymer is ransomware designed to encrypt the files of its target, preventing them from accessing files and subsequently encouraging the victim to pay a ransom to decrypt the files. Used by an eCrime group called INDRIK SPIDER, the DoppelPaymer malware is a form of BitPaymer ransomware and was first discovered in 2019 by CrowdStrike software endpoint protection company. Recently, the ransomware was used in an attack against the City of Torrance in California. More than 200 GB of data was stolen, with the attackers demanding 100 Bitcoin in ransom. Other reports reveal that the same malware was used to attack the city of Alabama state’s information technology system. The attackers threatened to publish citizens’ private data online unless they are paid $300,000 in Bitcoin. The attack came after warnings from a cybersecurity firm based in Wisconsin. A cybersecurity specialist analyzing the case mentioned that the attack that had brought down the city’s email system was made possible through the username of a computer belonging to the city’s manager of information systems.Data from Chainalysis shows that the DoppelPaymer malware is responsible for one of the largest payouts, one of only two to reach the $100,000 mark.According to a report by cybersecurity provider Check Point, the Dridex malware entered the top-10 list of malware for the first time in March 2020 after an initial appearance in 2011. The malware, also known as Bugat and Cridex, specializes in stealing bank credentials using a system of macros on Microsoft Word. However, new variants of the malware go beyond Microsoft Word and now target the entire Windows platform. Researchers note that the malware can be lucrative for criminals thanks to its sophistication, and is now being used as a ransomware downloader.Even though last year saw the takedown of a botnet linked to Dridex, experts believe that such successes are often short-lived, as other crime groups can pick up the malware and use it for other attacks. However, the ongoing global pandemic has further escalated the use of malware such as Dridex, easily executed through email phishing attacks, as more people are required to stay and work from home.Another malware that has resurfaced as a result of the coronavirus pandemic is the Ryuk Ransomware, which is known for targeting hospitals. On March 27, a spokesman of a British-based IT security firm confirmed that despite the global pandemic, Ryuk ransomware is still being used to target hospitals. Like most cyberattacks, the Ryuk malware is distributed via spam emails or geo-based download functions.The Ryuk malware is a variant of Hermes, which is linked to the SWIFT attack in October 2017. It is believed that the attackers who have been using Ryuk since August have pulled in over 700 Bitcoin across 52 transactions. As the ransomware landscape continues to be overcrowded by novel malicious solutions, cybercriminal groups such as the REvil (Sodinokibi) ransomware gang have seemingly evolved with the times with increased sophistication of their operation. The REvil gang operates as a RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) and creates malware strains that it sells to other criminal groups. A report by security team KPN reveals that the REvil malware has infected more than 150,000 unique computers across the globe. Yet these infections only emerged from a sample of 148 strains of the REvil ransomware. Each strain of the REvil ransomware is deployed according to the infrastructure of the company’s network to increase chances of infection.Recently, the notorious REvil ransomware gang launched an auction to sell off stolen data from companies unable to pay the ransom with prices starting at $50,000 payable in Monero (XMR). Out of privacy concerns, the REvil gang switched from demanding payment in Bitcoin to Monero, a privacy-centric cryptocurrency.As one of the most active and aggressive ransomware operators, the REvil gang is primarily targeting corporations, encrypting their files and asking for astronomical fees averaging about $260,000.On May 27, Microsoft’s security team revealed in a series of tweets information regarding a new ransomware called “Pony Final,” which uses brute force to get access to its target network infrastructure to deploy ransomware.Unlike most malware that use phishing links and emails to trick the user into launching the payload, PonyFinal is distributed using a combination of a Java Runtime Environment and MSI files that deliver malware with a payloader that is activated manually by the attacker. Like Ryuk, PonyFinal is mainly being used to attack healthcare institutions amid the COVID-19 crisis.Despite the overall increase in the number of cyberattacks, experts believe there is a decrease in the number of successful attacks, since for most corporations, ransomware attacks amid a global pandemic are proving to be a final stroke, leaving them unable to pay the ransom. This is evident in a report published by malware lab Emsisoft on April 21, revealing a significant drop in the number of successful ransomware attacks in the U.S. Likewise, a Chainalysis report published in April found a significant decrease in ransomware payments since the coronavirus pandemic intensified in the U.S. and Europe. So it seems that despite the growing number of attacks, victims are not paying the ransoms, leaving criminal groups like REvil with no other option but to auction out the stolen data. It is also likely that a call for employees to work from home has paradoxically posed a new challenge for hackers. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Emsisoft’s threat analyst Brett Callow stated:“It’s very obvious to ransomware attackers that they’ve got a potentially valuable target when they hit a corporate endpoint. It may however be less obvious when they hit a personal device that an employee is using while working remotely, and which is only connected to corporate resources on an intermittent basis.”"
457,"Tesla’s market capitalization has surged from about $76 billion at the start of 2020 to $224.18 billion at market close on July 2. This unending rally has also made it the largest car company in terms of market capitalization, even though it produces only a fraction of cars compared to the second-ranked Toyota motors. One of the reasons for the sharp rise in Tesla’s stock is investors’ expectation that the company will disrupt the cars running on fossil fuel. Similarly, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins are likely to disrupt fiat currencies and gold over the next few years. However, the current price of the top-ranked asset on CoinMarketCap does not capture this change. This shows that the crypto space is still in its early days of development and as the space matures cryptocurrency prices are likely to rise higher. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360Bitcoin’s fundamentals continue to improve and it is only a matter of time before the price plays catch up. However, until this happens, investors should be patient and use the dips to accumulate for the long-term. Instead of the vertical move seen in 2017, a gradual up move should be preferred as it is likely to last longer. The bulls could not propel Bitcoin (BTC) above the 20-day exponential moving average ($9,270), which shows that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance. However, a minor positive is that the buyers again stepped in and purchased the dip below $9,000 on July 2, suggesting accumulation at lower levels.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe 20-day EMA is gradually sloping down and the relative strength index is sustaining below the 50 level, which suggests that bears have a minor advantage. A break below $8,825 will open the doors for a fall to the next minor support at $8,638.79 and below it to the critical level at $8,130.58.Conversely, if the bulls can push the BTC/USD pair above the 50-day simple moving average ($9,410), a rally to $10,000 is possible. It will be an uphill task for the bulls to clear the stiff resistance zone of $10,000–$10,500 but if the momentum can carry the price above this zone, a new sustained uptrend is likely.Ether (ETH) again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($230) on July 2, which suggests that the bears are selling on minor rallies to critical overhead resistance levels. However, the bears are not able to maintain the selling pressure at lower levels.ETH/USD daily chart.

The bears might defend the 50-day SMA ($0.193) aggressively but if the bulls can push the price above it, a trend change is likely.Conversely, if the bears can sink the price below the $0.172205–$0.169012 support zone, the decline can extend to the support line of the channel. A break below the channel is likely to intensify selling resulting in a long liquidation. The next support on the downside is the $0.14–$0.13 zone.The bulls seem to be in no hurry to buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH) even at the current levels because they are not confident that the altcoin will start its journey northward. However, they have not allowed the price to dip below $217.55 either, which suggests accumulation at lower levels.BCH/USD daily chart.

Nevertheless, if the BCH/USD pair again turns down from the 20-day EMA ($230), it will indicate that the bears are aggressively selling on minor rallies. A break below $217.55 can drag the price to $200 and if this support also cracks, a new downtrend is likely.The first support on the downside is $180 and if that gets broken, the decline can extend to $165.Although the bulls purchased the dip to $149.57 on July 1, they have not been able to push the price above $162.53, which suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears will now try to sink Bitcoin SV (BSV) below the $146.20–$135 zone.BSV/USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf successful, the sixth-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap can decline to $120 and then to $100. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI close to the oversold territory indicates that the path of least resistance is to the downside.Contrary to this assumption, if the BSV/USD pair rebounds sharply from $146.20 and climbs above $170, it will signal that the bulls have overpowered the bears. That will increase the likelihood of the pair gradually rising to $200 and then to $227. The bulls have not been able to push Litecoin (LTC) even to the 20-day EMA ($42.64) in the past five days, which suggests a lack of urgency to buy even at these levels as the bulls are not confident that a bottom is in place yet.LTC/USD daily chart.

However, it is unlikely to be a waterfall decline as the bulls will try to stall the decline at $35 and then again at $32.50.If the seventh-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap rises from the current levels and breaks above the moving averages, it will signal strength and increase the possibility of a rally to $51.After a strong breakout from the symmetrical triangle on July 1, Cardano (ADA) completed a quick retest of the breakout level on July 2.

The 20-day EMA continues to slope down and the RSI is close to 40 levels, which shows that bears have the upper hand.BNB/USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe bears will now try to sink the ninth-ranked crypto-asset on CoinMarketCap below $14.80 and if they succeed, a drop to $13.65 is possible. This is a critical level and if this also cracks, a new downtrend could start.Conversely, if the BNB/USD pair bounces off $13.65, it could signal an extension of the range-bound action for a few more days.Instead, if the pair rises from the current levels and climbs above the 50-day SMA ($16.50), a move to $18.1377 is likely. A break above this resistance could start a new uptrend.There is a tough tussle in progress between the bulls and the bears at the critical support at $2.3314.

He believes Bitcoin to be digital gold. With that thesis comes the expectation that there will be immense growth in the asset’s market capitalization. “Bitcoin in its final stages decades from now will be something very boring. Like our grandkids will go, 'Grandpa, Grandma, I only hear about Bitcoin. Everyone's got Bitcoin.' It's like, who cares? Like it's a boring investment. It's like holding cash.”Held predicts Bitcoin to hold from $5 trillion to $100 trillion dollars of value in its “final stages.” This would result in a transformation from a highly volatile asset to a “very boring” currency.Held’s belief in Bitcoin is unshakeable. He’s seen his net worth go up and drop 80% three times. And yet, 90% of his current net worth remains in Bitcoin. His unwillingness to diversify his portfolio comes from a staunch belief that blockchain technology is only useful for Bitcoin.“Satoshi purposely built blockchain tech to build Bitcoin. Blockchain tech sucks. It's terrible. It makes so many tradeoffs to build Bitcoin that it is basically ineffective for almost anything else.”Under this line of thought, which he calls “Bitcoin minimalism” to spite Vitalik Buterin, he doesn’t see a reason for altcoins to exist. To Held, altcoins are just experiments that have yet to prove blockchain is useful for anything but Bitcoin.For more crypto interviews, market updates and everything in between, head over to the Cointelegraph YouTube channel, and hit that subscribe button!"
459,"In recent months, a number of class-action lawsuits have been filed against Ripple for selling its XRP token in an unregistered securities offering. So far, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has not published any official statement on this, which has kept everyone guessing.To help put an end to the uncertainty, Chris Giancarlo, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, published a paper last week arguing that Ripple’s XRP is not a security. Giancarlo is famous for helping establish the CFTC’s stance that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are not securities. So, it would seem that he is the right person to be making this case.The only trouble is that Giancarlo is no longer working for the CFTC — he is now in private practice. Not only that, but he is also currently working for a law firm that is on Ripple’s payroll. Given the clear conflict of interest here, before reading the paper I prepared myself to expect some bias. However, I never could have imagined how bad it would be.I know this kills the suspense, but there’s no way to mince words here: The case made in Giancarlo’s paper for Ripple’s sale of XRP to not be considered a securities offering is nonsensical and absurd, so much so that it boggles my mind that Giancarlo was willing to publicly put his name on it.Read on in today’s article as I go through Giancarlo’s analysis of whether or not the sale of XRP is a securities offering along with a real analysis of whether or not it is.Related: Is XRP a Security? We May Never KnowThe Howey Test is the SEC’s principal method of determining whether or not an investment is a securities offering. If it is, the issuer must either register the offering with the SEC or ensure that the offering fits within a recognized registration exemption.As a quick refresher, the Howey Test comprises four prongs that were established in a 1946 Supreme Court case. The ruling was that an investment contract exists where there is:“A contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests his money [prong one] in a common enterprise [prong two] and is led to expect profits [prong three] solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party [prong four].”In order for the sale of XRP to be considered a securities offering, it must meet every one of these prongs. If the offering fails even one of them, then it is not considered a securities offering.Read on to see the case for how XRP stacks up against the Howey Test.The first prong of the Howey Test is pretty straightforward: Was there an investment of money in the transaction?In his analysis, Giancarlo claims that XRP doesn’t meet this prong of the Howey Test because “the common understanding of the term ’investment’ is the transfer of something of value in exchange for a future return rather than a present one.”At first glance, this sounds reasonable. However, the idea of “investment” as an expectation of future return is handled by the Howey Test’s “expectation of profit” prong. There is no reason to confuse it here with the “investment of money” prong.Essentially, Giancarlo is presenting a circular argument to avoid admitting the obvious: There is no way to say that there was not an investment of money here. People clearly paid money in exchange for XRP tokens. There’s no other way to see this. I think nearly all courts analyzing this would agree that there was an investment of money.Remember, just because the XRP offering passes this prong of the Howey Test does not mean that Ripple held an unregistered securities offering. The offering still must pass all of the other prongs of the Howey Test. So, Giancarlo did not have to go to such creative lengths to try to argue against this prong. Of all the prongs that could be met, none are stronger than this one.Yes — there was without a doubt an investment of money when people purchased XRP. Ripple owned XRP and sold it for U.S. dollars. End of story.The next prong of the Howey Test primarily refers to whether or not the returns are shared by those that have invested based on the efforts of a common enterprise. This prong is likely met as well because all holders of XRP share in the gains and losses when the value of their tokens goes up and down based on the managerial efforts of Ripple.In Giancarlo’s paper, he asserts that there is no common enterprise in this case because “a holder of XRP is not entitled to share in the profits and losses of Ripple.”This is a terrible argument. There are countless investments that are classified as securities that don’t allow you to share in the profits or losses of the company. Take a bond, for example. You do not share in the profits or losses of the company or government that issued it, yet a bond is undoubtedly a security.Next, Giancarlo compares Ripple to Bitcoin to help support his argument. He claims that holders of XRP are no different than holders of BTC, and if BTC isn’t a security, then neither is XRP.Sadly, there is a big, gaping flaw in this argument: Bitcoin’s development is truly decentralized, whereas XRP is dominated by Ripple. So, the holders of XRP are obviously in a common enterprise, as their fate is pooled equally and depends almost entirely on the development efforts of Ripple. The XRP network requires constant work, and much of the token’s use depends on its future development. So, to argue that there’s no common enterprise is plainly denying reality.Giancarlo argues against this reality by claiming that the XRP ledger would function without Ripple’s involvement. And while it is true that if Ripple were to shut down today, XRP would continue to exist, it’s also true that XRP’s price would plummet and use of the platform would disintegrate.Yes — XRP holders have invested in a common enterprise. All funds are pooled by Ripple to build out the system, and users all benefit or lose from the corresponding fluctuations in the token’s price.In his paper, Giancarlo argues that there was no expectation of profits because Ripple never officially promised any sort of profit or return to investors and has instead stressed that the main purpose of XRP is for liquidity.This was a wise move for Ripple, as any marketing of potential earnings, or price increases in XRP, would have automatically gotten its sales of XRP flagged by the SEC. But just because Ripple doesn’t promise future profits in its marketing does not mean that people don’t purchase XRP with the expectation of profit. Anyone who has been following crypto at all over the past few years knows that people buy XRP with the hopes that its price will go up.XRP was one of the most successful tokens at one point. To argue that there is no expectation of profit is absurd, not to mention futile. Both Kik and Telegram tried to make this argument with the SEC and were shot down.Then Giancarlo goes on and makes a ridiculous comparison between XRP and Bitcoin, arguing that because Bitcoin is not a security, XRP fails to meet this prong.But again, this comparison is grossly flawed. Bitcoin is not a security because it fails to meet all the prongs of the Howey Test. So, even though people do buy BTC with an expectation of profits, it is not a security because the other prongs of the Howey Test are not met.Although Giancarlo does his best, his arguments in this prong are circular and nonsensical.Yes — users bought XRP with the hopes that its price would go up.The final prong refers to whether or not profits come from a person’s individual efforts or wholly the efforts of the third party they’ve invested in. Though Giancarlo does not take the time to thoroughly explain his case on this prong, he asserts that profits from holding XRP are not derived wholly from the efforts of the Ripple team. His argument is that “the XRP architecture is fully autonomous and exists entirely independently of Ripple.” To support this, he points to the fact that most of Ripple’s XRP is held in escrow and that the amount that is released is controlled by Ripple’s program. Control over the supply of the token is just one minor way of influencing the token’s price.Just have a look at the Ripple website and you’ll see the comprehensive team behind Ripple that is pushing forward the token’s development and its adoption with institutional investors.As mentioned above, it is possible that the XRP ledger could continue to function without the Ripple team. But that would undoubtedly bring down the price of the token dramatically. As such, it is clear that XRP’s growth and the corresponding profits for token holders depend heavily on the efforts of the Ripple team.Yes — purchasers of XRP are simply passive investors that are counting on the work of the Ripple core team to come up with new products, promote adoption and boost the value of the token overall.In my opinion, XRP clearly meets all of the prongs of the Howey Test and would be considered a security. Through his paper, Giancarlo relies heavily on the assumption that Bitcoin and Ether failed every prong of the Howey Test, which simply isn’t true.His entire argument was amateurish and intentionally misleading. Very distinct prongs were lumped together and supported with nonsensical legalese to confuse and distract.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Dean Steinbeck is a U.S. corporate lawyer with a focus on data privacy and technology.

Source: Hsaka/ TwitterFurther data from on-chain analyst Skew confirms the trend. At present, around 4 pm UTC marks the most intense time of day for Bitcoin trading. Again using Coinbase, in addition to Binance, Skew finds that midweek is also more intense than the start or end of the working week. Weekends, as is often noted, are quieter still.Bitcoin trading volume one-month summary. Source: SkewAs an example, over the past 30 days, Coinbase saw an average of $6.5 million in volume between 3 pm and 4 pm UTC. The quietest hour, 9 am, saw just $2 million.Those times correspond to around 12 pm EST, or 2.5 hours after New York markets officially open. The data may have unearthed changing tendencies among Bitcoin traders, possibly due to the increasing prevalence of institutions within the market.Last year, Cointelegraph reported on research that indicated that at the time, the most active trading time in terms of volume was 1 am UTC.Taken from a 2017–2019 average, the research suggested that at the time, Asian traders had a noticeable impact. Since then, the composition of the Bitcoin trading arena has undergone a metamorphosis, with bigger players and more capital entering. As was recently covered by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin derivatives markets continue to set volume and open interest records in 2020."
461,"A new report analyzing on-chain activity says that Bitcoin (BTC) is now due for a bullish phase based on supply movements.Published by asset manager Stack Funds on July 2, the findings suggest that 90-day active supply is dictating bullish potential for BTC/USD.Publishing an accompanying chart for the metric, Stack argued that it has important implications for historical price behavior.“The data provides an indication of two folds. Firstly, the 90d % of Bitcoin active supply has tapered over the past 3 years, from 36% to 17%, suggesting that investors’ time horizon has lengthened as Bitcoin are held over longer periods in their wallets,” the report states. “Secondly, prior to the 2017 and 2019 bull run, where Bitcoin hit $20,000 and $14,000 highs against the dollar, there was evidence of steep surges in the 90d % active supply (depicted in the green zones).”The trend has appeared since Bitcoin’s price crash in March, an event which proved to be something of a watershed moment for traders.Stack concluded:“As statistics have shown, a potential run-up in Bitcoin prices can be expected, which has yet to materialise, leading us to believe that the preceding rise in Bitcoin prices could happen sooner rather than later.”Bitcoin 90-day active supply 3-year chart. Source: Stack FundsStack comes hot on the heels of a highly bullish report from Bloomberg, which last month eyed price-performance exceeding $12,000.Current ranging price behavior around $9,000 is “compression” for Bloomberg, and a reaction should come in the form of gains in the short term.“Volatility should continue declining as Bitcoin extends its transition to the crypto equivalent of gold from a highly speculative asset, yet we expect recent compression to be resolved via higher prices,” analysts summarized.While many indicators are encouraging, it is the demand which is clearly bullish. This, the report continues, is also the “most important” category to win over for Bitcoin.As such, Bloomberg joins various others, including Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, in forecasting a potential price target of $12,000.“Increasing addresses used, on-exchange investment product inflows and futures open interest create firmer underpinnings for the benchmark crypto,” it states. “The number of active Bitcoin addresses used, a key signal of the 2018 price decline and 2019 recovery, suggests a value closer to $12,000, based on historical patterns.”Beyond that level, the bullish potential by no means fades. In a technical prognosis, Bloomberg describes Bitcoin as a “caged bull” which can hit even higher levels.“About $8,000-$10,000 is the primary consolidation range,” it explains. “We see Bitcoin, at about $9,200 on June 25, as more likely to head toward the 2019 high close of just below $13,000 than sustaining under $8,000.”A classic indicator, Bollinger Bands, points to a breakout “soon.” Historically accurate at charting volatility in either direction, the bands have shown characteristic narrowing in recent weeks — a key precursor to bigger price movements.BTC/USD 6-month chart showing Bollinger Bands.

462,"The share price of Bitcoin (BTC) mining firms Riot Blockchain and Hive Blockchain has produced enormous year-to-date gains, with stock in Riot nearly doubling while Hive’s has tripled over 2020 so far.However, not all mining firms have fared well throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with Canaan’s stock falling nearly 70% since early January, and both Hut 8 and DMG Blockchain seeing scant YTD gains despite experiencing significant volatility this year.While Bitcoin is up more than 26% from roughly $7,200 to $9,100 since the start of the year, the leading cryptocurrency’s gains have been dramatically overshadowed by a handful of firms mining it.Hive Blockchain has seen a dramatic performance this year, rallying more than 420% from the start of 2020 until mid-February, from $0.066 to $0.345. The firm’s shares crashed back to $0.118 over the next month as immediate economic fallout from the coronavirus took effect. However, an expansion that led to Hive doubling its mining capacity saw its stock rebound to test the $0.033 area by mid-May. HIVE/CAD 2020 YTD: GoogleThe firm’s shares have since fallen back to $0.228.After starting the year trading for $1.22, Riot Blockchain shares rallied to $1.60 by mid-February before crashing to $0.65 in roughly one month. However, Riot produced a strong recovery, gaining over 375% to trade for $3.10 on June 10. The firm’s shares have since retraced to $2.29.RIOT/CAD 2020 YTD: GoogleRiot’s recovery may have been boosted by announcements in May that its mining revenues had grown 70% in the first quarter year-on-year, its plans to roughly double its hash rate after Bitcoin’s block reward halving, and the dismissal of pump-and-dump complaints against the firm.Riot also expanded its total hash rate capability after establishing a hosting arrangement for its Antminer S17s with fellow mining firm Coinmint in April after facing disruptions resulting from COVID-19.However, the gains enjoyed by Riot and Hive are certainly not indicative of all miners, with Canaan suffering huge losses over 2020 so far.After starting the year at $6.02, Canaan shed over a quarter of its value by mid-Feb — when a sudden spike pushed prices up to $8.04 in a single day. Canaan’s stock then plummeted to $2.81 in mid-March, before embarking on a steady recovery to retest $6 two months later.RIOT/USD 2020 YTD: GoogleSince May 14, Canaan’s price has crashed by more than two-thirds to currently trade for $1.82.While the YTD performance for Hut 8 and DMG Blockchain are currently sitting at an approximate break-even, both firms have seen extreme volatility during 2020.

463,"The Bank of Japan has announced it will begin experimenting with a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, to check its feasibility from a technical perspective.The BoJ wants to digitize cash, but it remains to be seen if Japan can catch up with China, which has already begun testing its own CBDC. This is the first time the BoJ has revealed it would commence a proof-of-concept process with the digital yen, but the bank is yet to reveal a timetable.In a report called Technical Hurdles for CBDC, the bank stated it would “check the feasibility of CBDC from technical perspectives, collaborate with other central banks and relevant institutions, and consider introducing a CBDC.”In February, news emerged that the central banks of Britain, the eurozone, Japan, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland announced a plan to collaborate on researching issuing digital currencies.In its report, the BoJ considers two major technical hurdles: universal access and resilience. The former refers to providing accessibility to everyone, including those without a smartphone. Surprisingly, according to Nikkei, as of 2018, only 65% of Japanese people have smartphones. The BoJ said, “It is important to develop the CBDC to be available to a variety of users.” “Resilience” refers to offline availability when electric power is down. The BoJ emphasized the importance of accessibility in any kind of environment, even in an emergency situation such as an earthquake. The BoJ is considering whether or not to use blockchain for the CBDC. A centralized system has the merits of “having large capacities and fast transaction speed” but the entire system can suddenly go down if there is a single point of failure.In contrast, DLT-based CBDCs can overcome a single point of failure and show resilience but require a longer amount of time to transact, as blockchain networks require consensus among multiple validators. The BoJ concluded:“Both centralized and decentralized types have pros and cons. […] In the case of massive transactions for retail use cases in advanced countries, it is better to adopt the centralized type. [...] In the case where the amount of transaction is limited and resilience and future possibility are prioritized, there is room to consider the decentralized type.”In April, China’s digital yuan was reportedly tested in the cities of Shenzhen, Chengdu, Suzhou and Xiongan."
464,"Balaji Srinivasan has offered $1,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) to the first Twitter user who can get Vox’s technology news website Recode to retract a story about Silicon Valley’s ‘overreaction’ to COVID-19 in February.The former CTO of Coinbase made the offer on Twitter today. He specifically targeted Kara Swisher, the co-founder and editor-at-large of Recode.Srinivasan says he will give $1,000 — or 0.11 BTC at the time of writing — to anyone who is able to provide “a timestamped reply from [Recode] agreeing to correct the piece” and a publication of the correction. Kara Swisher still hasn't run a formal retraction for Recode's dangerously false reporting on COVID-19.

Since their business model does not incentivize truth, the public will have to do it.

$1000 #Bitcoin bounty for the first person who can get them to correct the record. https://t.co/nyz2LqiU0fAccording to Srinivasan, the article — featuring tweets he wrote regarding fecal transmission of the virus during the Chinese New Year celebrations — was clickbait and conveyed “wrong science.”The story was released on Feb. 13 and Srinivasan immediately took to Twitter to claim that the article contained “many statements that are false or omit so much context they mislead readers,” including that the risk in transmitting the virus in public settings was low, and that the CDC did not recommend reducing the use of handshakes. In the piece, reporter Shirin Ghaffary, did seem to be making light of the actions of a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who took precautions like not meeting anyone in person who had traveled to China, and ordering a hazmat suit and respirator for protection.At the time the piece was written, there were fewer than twenty confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States, the CDC had only issued a statement confirming the first person-to-person transmission in the country two weeks earlier, and lockdowns were something that only happened in China. It was a simpler time. Recode did request an interview with Srinivasan for the piece, but rather than respond he reposted her message to his 226,000 followers on Twitter on February 7, saying he would have been “happy to engage if [he] thought it was in good faith” but was not interested.In the months following this exchange, Srinivasan has continued his campaign against the media, taking swipes at journalists calling them “sociopaths” and “disgraceful.” New York Times reporter Taylor Lorenz claims he constantly ranted about her online, attacking her education, writing, career, “and worse.”Reactions to the Bitcoin bounty were mixed, with many horrified that a prominent voice on Twitter would use a term like “bounty” to describe an action against journalists. “Are you inciting people to make threats or something?” user ItIsOurCorn said. Others were more direct:“What psychopath sits there and puts out a bounty for random strangers (potentially violent or mentally ill) to literally harass people? How do you consider yourself at all ethical?”A few agreed that while the original article had its faults, a bounty was not the solution. “Agree they should issue an apology and retraction over that article,” said Crypto_JoeRogan. “But this is maybe not the best way to go about it.” "
465,"On July 2, crypto security firm ZenGo identified a double-spend exploit targeting several popular Bitcoin (BTC) wallets, dubbed ‘BigSpender’Of nine cryptocurrency wallets tested by ZenGo, BRD, Ledger Live, and Edge were found to have been vulnerable to the attack. The three companies updated their products after ZenGo notified them of the threat, however the firm warned that “millions” of crypto users may have been exposed to the exploit prior to its identification.Despite the wallets’ move to protect against BigSpender, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) proponent Hayden Otto claims the vulnerability is inherent to Bitcoin “by design” and can still be exploited.BigSpender was discovered through ZenGo’s ongoing research into Bitcoin’s ‘Replace-by-Fee’ (RBF) feature. According to the security firm, “RBF is a standard method to allow users to ‘undo’ a yet to be confirmed transaction, by sending another transaction spending the same coins (but possibly different destination) with a higher fee”.BigSpender is not the first time an exploit has targeted RBF vulnerabilities to execute a double-spend attack, with a similar technique being notoriously outlined in a video published by Otto in December that quickly went viral. The exploit is only possible with zero confirmations.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Otto stated that RBF attack's are “particularly concerning for BTC-accepting merchants who could have easily handed over goods to a customer who then reversed their BTC transaction upon leaving the store.”“The technique is facilitated by RBF (replace by fee), a so-called ‘feature’ added at the protocol level by the Bitcoin Core developers.The issue exists if you use BTC. Wallet software can only make some trade off, which results in a worse BTC user experience, in order to try to protect BTC users.”The BCH proponent described the exploit as “an issue with BTC itself,” adding that it has “nothing to do with the various wallet software”.However, not everyone is convinced that BigSpender comprises a grave threat to Bitcoin, with the affected wallet providers challenging the language employed by ZenGo’s researchers.Speaking to Forbes: Ledger asserted: “There is no actual double-spend being performed. The user funds stay safe. Nevertheless, the display of received transactions could be misleading.”This is of course, what Otto exploited: getting merchants to hand over the goods before the funds were transferred due to a “misleading” display. However, merchants who wait for transactions to be confirmed before sending goods do not risk being affected.ZenGo has released a free open-source tool that allows wallet providers to test their products and secure against the BigSpender vulnerability. The firm noted that not all of the wallets affected by the exploit have implemented upgrades"
466,"Mike Alfred, co-founder and CEO of data analytics outfit Digital Assets Data, recently pointed toward miners as a potential catalyst for recent Bitcoin (BTC) price activity. “It is tough to say definitively, but it appears as though the miners' actions are having a direct, immediate impact on price,” Alfred told Cointelegraph on July 1. “This is especially evident during outlier events like on the 23rd, where we saw miners offload >300% more BTC than they mined that day,” he added, referencing June 23 activity. Image courtesy of Digital Assets Data""Rolling MRI (Miner's Rolling Inventory) has declined significantly since the halving, meaning that miners are holding onto more BTC than they are mining, Alfred said in June 18 comments to Cointelegraph, referencing a notable uptick in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty. In contrast, MRI flew upward on June 23, Alfred told Cointelegraph on July 1. On paper, this essentially means greater miner focus on selling, which could be one of the reasons for Bitcoin’s downward price action as of late. Bitcoin has largely traded sideways for the last two months, although recent pressure slightly favors sellers. After a move up to $9,780 on June 22, the asset dropped in the days following, sitting at a press time price of $9,085, according to TradingView.com data. “Bitcoin is likely to head for a re-test of the daily MA 200, after breaching, retesting and getting rejected at the upslanting trendline from the March 20 peak, May 10 lows and beyond” CNBC Africa crypto analyst and Twitter personality BigCheds told Cointelegraph on July 2.The 200-day moving average, or MA, referenced by BigCheds currently sits near $8,360. The trendline of which Cheds spoke acted as price resistance for Bitcoin on March 20, near $6,980, as well as held support on the flipside of the trendline on May 10, near $8,100. Fairly recently, Bitcoin broke through this trendline to the downside, retesting the level as newfound resistance. Bitcoin pulled back below $9,000 again today before popping back above the level by press time."
467,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $9,000 in a rapid pullback, falling by 5% in 48 hours. It marked the seventh drop to the $8,000s for the top-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization within a span of two months, since early May. Thus, traders have been concerned that repeated drops below $9,000 may weaken a critical support level. Meanwhile, only $30 million worth of futures contracts were liquidated on the recent drop on BitMEX. The futures data indicates there exists a possibility of a bigger drop.Bitcoin was due for a major price movement following nearly two months of low volatility. The direction of BTC’s next move was uncertain because BTC/USD was at a pivotal point.Technically, if Bitcoin stayed above $9,200, a potential retest of $9,500 and the $10,000 resistance levels were plausible. But the continuous retests of the $9,000 support level may leave BTC vulnerable to a deep pullback.One cryptocurrency trader “Cheds” noted:“Breaking down through 9k, this latest drop invalidates a potential inverse head and shoulders reversal with a breach of the right shoulder. Same thing happened on June 25th.”A 4-hour chart of Bitcoin with a Bollinger Band. Source: ChedsOn June 25, the price of Bitcoin dropped to as low as $8,827 in a rapid fall, primarily triggered by a sell-off of several miners. Data from ByteTree suggests some miners have started to sell more Bitcoin than usual once again this time around.In the past week, 6,619 BTC were mined and 6,809 were sold. Miners sold more Bitcoin than they mined, leaving a negative net inventory of 190 BTC.The selling pressure that caused BTC to drop from $9,250 to $8,932 likely came from miners and the spot market. The futures market had a relatively weak impact on the large price drop of Bitcoin given the low amount of shorts liquidation on BitMEX.Still, for the price of Bitcoin to drop to major multi-month support levels like $6,000, some traders believe that BTC would have to drop below $8,000. For example, Bitcoin trader Pentarhudi wrote in early June:“Triple top on daily… bearish pattern. Will trigger at close below $8000 with a target to $6000. Either triple top or range lock.”If the Bitcoin price continues to fall in the next several days to the low $8,000s, it would signify a triple top at a larger time frame. The two previous tops were achieved in October 2019 and February 2020, when BTC hit $10,500.A potential triple top in play for Bitcoin.

Throughout the past three months, however, BTC and equities moved in tandem for most of the time.The breakdown in the correlation between Bitcoin and stocks indicates that markets are moving based on their respective dynamics. It may cause BTC to see sudden bursts of volatility once again, following a shift in the trend of recent weeks."

470,"According to crypto advocate Roger Ver, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the only “recent” coin to be widely used on the dark web. “The only other coins being used on the darknet markets are the coins that have been around for a long time like Bitcoin, of course, then Monero,” Ver said.Coinelegraph’s investigation showed that although BCH does reach the Dark Web, it's far from being a leading cryptocurrency there. This is surprising: while privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero commonly protect the identities of darknet buyers and sellers alike, Bitcoin Cash has some technical features that can bring its level of privacy into the same arena. When those privacy features combine with BCH’s famous transaction speeds, the currency seems a natural choice to drive a technologically enabled black market.So why hasn’t it happened yet?A Bitcoin.com report states that BCH accounted for more than 10% of the overall transaction volume on the Dark Web. Miguel Gomez, head of research at PrivacyAffairs, confirmed to Cointelegraph that BCH is one of the most popular coins on the Dark Web: ""As for cryptocurrency's role, the major coins (Bitcoin, BCH, and Monero) are the most prevalent.”Cointelegraph could not identify a single operational Dark Web market that accepts BCH as a default form of payment. The customer support at BetFixed was willing to accept BCH via email — Bitcoin.com recently introduced such a service — but this was an exception to the norm.Cointelegraph also found that one of the Dark Web’s many hitmen services was willing to accept BCH payment, though they have preference for BTC. The murder-for-hire service representative responded to a customer inquiry about privacy by stating that they mix the coins twice. They also indicated that they had never used BCH before.Based on our research, Bitcoin remains the most widely accepted currency in this space, with Monero coming in a close second. One operation called White House Market specifically accepts Monero and does not accept Bitcoin.Our observations were confirmed by Chainalysis, whose spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“We're not seeing meaningful BCH activity on darknet markets; they've received 260 USD in BCH so far in 2020. No large darknet markets are using BCH, with one marketplace saying they plan to implement it in the future.”In conversation with Cointelegraph, Ver lamented that many BCH users are not aware of the advanced privacy features implemented by Bitcoin Cash. One example is Schnorr signatures, which allow transactions to combine multiple signatures into a single signature. This can be useful for both enhanced privacy and increased scalability:“Bitcoin Cash already has Schnorr signatures today on the chain. Lots of wallets support it and Bitcoin Cash already has privacy tools today. In fact, while I’m sitting here, talking to you, my wallet is busy shuffling 56 additional Bitcoin Cash.”Although the patent for Schnorr signatures expired in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto chose not to use them in Bitcoin’s code for unknown reasons. This and other privacy-enhancing features are coming to Bitcoin soon, however. Bitcoin Core developer, Wladimir van der Laan, told Cointelegraph that more work needs to be done before these features can be safely implemented:“It's been making progress (for example the necessary parts will be integrated into secp256k1 library next) but overall I think it needs a lot more review and testing before it can be considered safe to include in consensus rules, there's no hurry and only one chance to get this right.It seems that BCH, despite providing better privacy to its users than its older brother, is not yet a popular choice amongst the underworld’s hustlers."
471,"Cross-platform database company, MongoDB, is the latest victim of a cybercriminal attack. This attack has infiltrated 22,900 unsecured databases by wiping their contents. The gang behind the attack has since requested Bitcoin (BTC) payments in exchange for a backup of the data.According to WeLiveSecurity from the cybersecurity firm ESET, if the ransom isn't paid in two days, the hacker, or a gang of cybercriminals, threatened to notify authorities in charge of enforcing European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.A report published by ZDNet explains that the number of databases compromised in the “Wiping & Ransom” attack account for almost 47% of all the MongoDB's databases.The hackers used an automated script to scan each database, and left a ransom note demanding 0.015 BTC, or around $140, for each one. The hackers also included a guide which explains to victims how they can purchase the required Bitcoin.Victor Gevers, a security researcher at the GDI Foundation, said:""The first few attacks lacked the data-wiping feature. Once the miscreant realized the mistake in their script, they amended it and started wiping the MongoDB databases. Instances of attacks using this particular ransom note have been recorded all the way back to April of this year.""In total, the hackers are seeking around $3.2M from MongoDB.In June, ransomware group, REvil, launched a series of attacks that targeted three companies in the U.S. and Canada. They later leaked data from two of the companies and threatened to disclose sensitive data from the third."
472,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been bouncing in the range between $8,600 and $10,000 for the past two months. BTC has shown little volatility since May, following a critical rejection at $10,440. However, five major fundamental factors still point toward a prolonged uptrend by 2021.According to data from Skew, the 10-day realized volatility of Bitcoin dropped to the lowest level of the year on June 24. This may indicate that traders are cautious because BTC is at a crucial price point. The performance of BTC over the next several weeks could hint at its price trend throughout the year’s end.Generally, the sentiment of cryptocurrency traders on the medium-term outlook of Bitcoin remains positive. In the short term, analysts see weakness in BTC and other leading cryptocurrencies due to external variables like the COVID-19 pandemic.Over the long run, strong macro factors suggest BTC is on track for a firm recovery. The most prominent piece of data that supports predictions of a positive trend is the increase in “HODLing” activity among investors.According to Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the chief technical officer at Glassnode, various HODLing data shows a rise in investor confidence. To start with, Bitcoin’s supply that has not moved for over a year has hit an all-time high, standing at 61%. It demonstrates the lack of appetite to sell BTC at the current price level. Shultze-Kraft said:“First, the obvious one: 61% (!) of Bitcoin supply that hasn’t moved in over a year — that’s an all-time high. Moreover, 44% hasn’t moved in 2+ years (approaching ATH), and almost 30% hasn’t moved in 3+ years. Loads of hodling here.”Shultze-Kraft further emphasized that a metric called “HODLer Net Position Change” shows investors accumulated Bitcoin heavily in 2020. The data portrays the unwillingness of many retail investors to sell BTC, noting that: “There have been only 16 days since the beginning of this year, in which the BTC Hodler Net Position Change has been negative.”If the BTC HODLer net position change remains positive, it means that investors are not moving funds from personal wallets to exchanges to sell. In March 2020, the price of Bitcoin dropped below $3,600 on several major futures exchanges. Altana Digital Currency Fund chief investment officer Alistair Milne suggested that if this drop could not shake investor confidence, there are not many factors that could in the future. Milne stated: “Similar levels of HODL last seen during a 3-month consolidation at around $400 before starting a two year bull run [...] Guesstimate that this cycle will peak around 70%?”Historically, bull runs in the cryptocurrency market coincided with an increase in HODL activity. At the start of 2018, for instance, the “HODL Wave” of Bitcoin started to rebound. From March to July of that year, BTC rose from around $4,000 to $14,000.As such, Philip Swift, the creator of cryptocurrency market data platform lookintobitcoin.com, stated: “Such high levels of HODLing have been present at the start of previous Bitcoin bull runs.”From March 2020, the assets under management of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust rose from $1.577 billion to $3.541 billion. The sharp increase in AUM suggests a similarly accelerating demand from institutional investors.Most specifically, United States institutions have a narrow selection of investment vehicles that can be used to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Without an exchange-traded fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is likely to remain the go-to vehicle for institutional investors.The AUM of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust hitting an all-time high, while the price of Bitcoin is down by more than 50% from its record high is a positive metric. This shows that institutions have confidence in the long-term trend of BTC, and more than they did three years ago.But, according to Messari researcher Ryan Watkins, reports of Grayscale buying most of the Bitcoin that is newly mined can be inflated. Watkins explained that Grayscale only bought 31% of newly mined Bitcoin since the May 11 halving:“Grayscale buys way less Bitcoin than many would think. Factoring in ‘in-kind’ purchases, Grayscale has only bought 31% of all new Bitcoins mined since the halving, far less than the 150%+ many have reported. This is just one of many misconceptions about Grayscale’s trusts.”While analysts note that it is critical to consider numbers that could potentially amplify the actual figures of the trust, accumulating 31% of mined Bitcoin is still a substantially high number.Nunya Bizniz, a cryptocurrency trader, said that the six-month chart of Bitcoin is set to see a Green 1, or G1, candle under the Tom Demark Sequential Indicator system. Each time a G1 candle appeared, Bitcoin saw a prolonged upsurge for several years. The trader also said: “A Green 1 candle signals the start of an upward trend. The six month candle will close today as a G1. Bull run ahead?”Along with several favorable technical structures and macro indicators, futures data also indicates that the market is not overbought. Typically, when the price of Bitcoin sees a large correction, it is triggered by the capitulation of overleveraged buyers. On futures exchanges like BitMEX, buyers often borrow capital with a leverage of up to 100x to place a long contract on Bitcoin. If BTC drops, it can cause a cascade of liquidations and an abrupt price fall.A technical analyst known as Byzantine General said the funding rate of the perpetual swap contract of BitMEX and open interest show that BTC is not overbought just yet. They said: “At the peak of the last rally in February, there were a lot of very clear signs that the market was overleveraged and overbought. But at the moment we don’t really have that.”Possibly due to the optimistic medium-term trend of Bitcoin, there was an increase in the number of high-net-worth investors moving funds off exchanges to personal wallets in recent months.The number of whales in the Bitcoin market has surpassed 1,800, based on data from Glassnode. But, given that the amount of BTC held by whales did not increase, it suggests the BTC market became less concentrated with new entrants.When the May 11 block reward halving occurred, analysts anticipated the hashrate of the Bitcoin blockchain network to fall sharply, since the event caused the amount of BTC mined to drop by half, thereby decreasing the revenues of most miners by up to 50% overnight.However, data from Blockchain.com shows that the hashrate of Bitcoin has recovered close to pre-halving levels. The mining industry remains healthy despite the halving, which might further brighten the sentiment around Bitcoin overall.The large mining centers based in Sichuan, China, remain largely profitable. The rainy season caused electricity rates to drop, reducing the cost of mining BTC. Consequently, miners have less incentive to sell large amounts of BTC in the near-term to cover costs. Typically, overleveraged miners are pressured to sell after halvings as the cost to mine Bitcoin spikes. This time around, the block reward halving was met with relatively low selling pressure.Therefore, a confluence of low selling pressure from miners, favorable long-term technical structure, increasing HODLing activity, a growing number of whales and rising institutional adoption raise the probability of a newfound rally by 2021."
473,"Reports circulating in Chinese media allege that Zhao Dong, head of the over-the-counter (OTC) crypto lending platform RenrenBit, has been detained by local police.The validity of these reports is not known at this time. Some say Dong is currently in a police station in Hangzhou, others claim he is in Yancheng.Matthew Graham, chief of Sino Global Capital, said through Twitter that reports about Zhao’s current situation seem “confirmed.”Graham clarifies that being detained is not the same as being arrested. He notes that the alleged detention may not have anything to do with RenrenBit’s operations.Quoting RenrenBit employees, Chainnews reported on July 2 that “all of the company’s staff have turned up for work as usual.”In addition to his role at RenrenBit, Zhao is known for being an investor behind the crypto exchange, Bitfinex.Chainnews alleges that the head of RenrenBit has been cooperating with the Chinese authorities related to suspicions of alleged fraud transactions performed by the company.Zhao stated in 2019 that he believed that the crypto spring will only come in 2020. When asked about the future of Bitcoin (BTC), Zhao Dong recalled the peak of the coin’s popularity in December 2017.In comparison to that time, no one cares about BTC today, he noted, adding that the coin will only draw attention when it reaches “many tens of thousands of dollars” once again."
474,"Digital technologies are entering every aspect of our life at a steady pace. However, according to predictions from Huawei in collaboration with Oxford Economics, the digital economy is expected to comprise 24.3% of the world’s gross domestic product by 2025, giving it an astronomical valuation of around $23 trillion. Among the few innovative technologies leading this revolution is blockchain.Even though blockchain came to be the core technology for Bitcoin (BTC), today it stands independent, impacting several industries, from gaming companies and enterprises to the manufacturing sector.The fact that data, once it is in the database, cannot be changed or deleted without informing all involved parties takes possible uses of this technology to a new level. That said, “Big Four” audit firm PwC surveyed 600 executives around the globe and found that 84% of respondents already use blockchain in their organization in one way or another.Although there are also many reports that this system needs more active monitoring — and there have been attempts by government authorities to do so — blockchain is here to stay.A report by analytics agency Gartner forecasts that by 2030, the blockchain market will be worth over $3.1 trillion. Adrian Lee, the senior research director at Gartner, said:""Product managers should prepare for rapid evolution, early obsolescence, a shifting competitive landscape, future consolidation of offerings and the potential failure of early stage technologies/functionality in the blockchain platform market.""Let’s find out how blockchain technology is changing various industries.Massively multiplayer online games, otherwise known as MMOs, have become hugely popular around the world, with people joining communities that allow them to engage in a shared ecosystem and earn currency or credit within the parameters of the platform. However, Horizon Blockchain Games is trying to revolutionize online gaming with its Ethereum-powered platform called Arcadeum. Horizon is trying to modify the idea of ownership in games. With Arcadeum, the company has a different take on in-game items. It establishes who owns a particular in-game item and then allows it to be traded verifiably, making the selling and buying of items easily traceable from player to player. With this project, Horizon is giving more control to players by leveraging technology that is typically associated with cryptocurrencies in order to build gaming features that resonate with users. The Arcadeum wallet operates as a secure wallet for gamers to store and manage their collectibles.For example, SkyWeaver, a free trading card game, uses the Ethereum blockchain to provide a reliable and secure environment for players to transfer ownership of their digital cards between one another. SkyWeaver has digitized the physical collectible card game using blockchain technology.Related: Investing in Blockchain Gaming: Why VCs Are Betting BigBP and Royal Dutch Shell announced in 2017 that they would lead a blockchain-based trading project with other members such as Statoil (now known as Equinor), Koch Supply & Trading, Gunvor and Mercuria, along with some banks such as ABN Amro, ING and Societe Generale. The project aimed to eliminate dependence on conventional paper contracts that produce huge amounts of paper documentation.Blockchain allows the energy sector to monitor its transactions, verify the origin of certificates, digitalize registries and control output. I think, in the long run, blockchain technology will help the energy sector reduce its operating costs, increase the reliability of its operations, and accelerate efficiency in domestic trading operations.Related: Blockchain Innovations in the Energy Sector, ExplainedBlockchain makes it possible for companies to track their manufactured goods throughout their lives, from shipping facilities to consumers in stores. Besides, as blockchain enables businesses to maintain a transparent flow of data, it allows coordinating details between all involved parties in the production and consumption chain.For example, using blockchain for automotive spare parts and warranties helps to track counterfeit products and even assists businesses in making informed decisions. It is often difficult to differentiate between spares and original parts based on their appearance. The percentage of low-quality spare parts is increasing in the market, and when they fail to perform soon after service, it damages the reputations of car manufacturers and dealers. However, blockchain technology can help manufacturing industries in various ways and within multiple niches.Blockchain technology within the automotive industry represents a powerful tool for data storage and transmission by smart cars. It can collectively store data about specific vehicles from various registries and help prevent falsification of data. For example, when a particular vehicle goes onto the market, its entire data will be available for the owner, including its repairs and services, the number of fixes, if it has been in any accidents and other information.It’s not wrong to say that significant players in the auto industry have been looking for opportunities to explore blockchain technology. A couple of years back, Toyota Research Institute revealed a new project that integrated blockchain into smart car technology to help maintain a registry for the exchange of data among smart vehicles. In addition, Volkswagen is in the development stage of coming up with a blockchain-based platform that enables smart cars to exchange information regarding road conditions. This technology can effectively help reduce the number of accidents and facilitate drivers by guiding them to prepare for or avoid severe weather conditions.For some of the world’s biggest companies and several industries, blockchain is no more the technology of the future. A lot of companies already understand how blockchain technology can revolutionize their business operations and processes, and some of these corporations are already at the implementation or planning stage of their blockchain-based systems. From financial systems to healthcare, blockchain is disrupting every single industry out there. I believe the integration of blockchain into company systems, enterprise apps and commercial institutions will positively impact the very core principles of the various industries that dominate the world today. Blockchain has the potential to change the worlds of industry and business just as the internet did, and the shift has already begun.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Jane Collen is a creative content writer and digital marketer at TekRevol.

475,"There’s a palpable buzz in crypto markets right now. Copy trading is gaining momentum, as it allows investors to emulate the moves of experienced traders.We spoke to Jay Smith, a popular trader on the eToro platform who is otherwise known as Jaynemesis, as well as to Kevin Stanely, the host of the podcast CRYPTO 101. Here, they tell us more about how this feature works, share their predictions for Bitcoin and reveal which altcoins they believe are being badly overlooked right now.1. Why would an established trader want someone to copy their moves? What’s in it for them?Jaynemesis: Money, respect, fame, community and fun! We’ve all seen the fake gurus on social media. If you’re actually good, prove it! On eToro, all of my trades and stats are 100% transparent, so there is no debating whether or not I know what I’m doing, and I have the numbers to back me up. It’s also great for anyone who really cares about the projects they invest in. When people copy you, they are helping build the projects you like.Kevin Stanely: An established trader wants someone to copy their moves because we love seeing people make money. Few things make us happier than being right, and there is no better way to gain respect and a devoted following than by putting your money where your mouth is, “opening up the kimono” and walking the walk.2. How can the people copying a trader know that data about a portfolio’s performance is accurate?Jaynemesis: Transparency is key. Not only can you look at someone’s stats page on eToro, but you can go through their trade history and calculate it yourself. You can copy virtually and test it out, or you can ask the thousands of other copiers within the eToro community if it really works. This has been my full-time job for over three years now, and most people take the fact that I don’t lose money for my copiers as quite convincing evidence that I know what I’m doing.Kevin Stanely: You have to trust the social trading platform that is hosting that data. That’s why we only use eToro — a brokerage that has been around for 13 years, has over 13 million registered users and has an overall untarnished reputation.3. Doesn’t all of the economic uncertainty brought about by COVID-19 make it impossible for even top traders to predict the markets?Jaynemesis: Big corrections provide big opportunities. There’s a Warren Buffet quote that comes to mind: ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.""Kevin Stanely: Not at all, and in fact, quite the opposite. It makes it far easier. There is a famous saying that goes, “Don’t fight the Fed.” I believe the Fed is the market, as it controls the supply of the money that is valuing assets. Put another way, money is not the “value,” but just the measuring stick of value.When you increase the amount of money in the system, assets get repriced higher in terms of the increased monetary base. The scarce assets such as shares of companies, gold, Bitcoin, etc., are the value. Indeed, their fundamentals have declined significantly — with a projected decline in cash flows, earnings, growth, etc. — but their stock prices are the same or even higher than where they were pre-COVID-19. How is that dislocation between stock price and value possible? Money supply.Over the course of the past few months, the Fed has bought trillions of dollars of junk debt in order to inflate the money supply. Moreover, it has stated it doesn’t expect rates to go above 0% until 2022. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, also went on CBS’s 60 Minutes to say there is infinite money. This is to signal to the market that the Fed is “backstopping” asset prices and will stop at nothing to ensure that the global financial system has plenty of liquidity.4. Do you buy into predictions that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 or believe PlanB’s stock-to-flow forecast that predicts it could reach $288,000 by 2024?Jaynemesis: I used to subscribe to making long-term predictions about Bitcoin, but these days I prefer to focus on the few months in front of me. I still believe it will eventually hit $100,000-plus per coin, but there are all sorts of black swan events that can blur the picture. After all, most people didn’t see COVID-19 coming.Kevin Stanely: Yes, absolutely. It is probably the single most robust quantitative model to forecast prices across commodities such as silver, gold and Bitcoin. I’m thinking that those prices will happen far, far, far sooner than 2024.5. Have you got any bold predictions for where the crypto industry will be this time next year?Jaynemesis: I actually believe the capitulation in altcoins will continue. The vast majority of alts have proven themselves incompetent at solving the problems they went out to fix after years of work. As the market matures, these altcoins will necessarily die out. Money and effort will instead be directed toward projects that are still showing great potential.Kevin Stanely: This time next year, we will be full swing into a crypto bull run. Right now, we have hardly even begun it, but in 12 months, we will be in the thick of it. People who I haven’t talked to in years will start reaching out to me asking about crypto, no doubt.Ethereum 2.0 will have had a successful launch and will be rolling out its new stages. Blockchains will begin to be fully interoperable, and I suspect we will see more financial institutions getting comfortable with crypto ownership.Layer-two scaling solutions will be rolling out, and many strong altcoins will be proving their theses. “Security tokens” will be a big trend but won’t be known as “security tokens.” We will just see transfer agents such as Carta and Broadridge start “feeling the heat” from smart contract platforms, which do the same thing they do, but in an automated, decentralized, instant way. Life will be far more optimized.6. Are there any cryptocurrencies that you believe are undervalued or overlooked?Jaynemesis: 1. Ethereum: It’s still here, and it’s still attracting big companies and developers. It’s a survivor.2. Basic Attention Token: I love this crypto. If you don’t know it yet, go install Brave as your main internet browser, and you’ll soon be converted.3. Augur: This is a complex project that’s had complex problems, but they continue to work on it, and the potential is vast, if they can make it work.Finally, I want to discuss IOTA. IOTA is extremely controversial, but I still believe in the words laid out by the founder when it first started: ""IOTA will either be worth trillions of dollars or nothing."" It’s an innovative approach to crypto, and the potential applications, if they can get it working properly, are huge.Kevin Stanely: Yes! They are all in our model portfolio, which is available at cryptorevolution.com!7. Do you use copy traders on eToro? And if so, how do you communicate with your copiers?Jaynemesis: I’ve been a popular investor on eToro since 2016, so I’ve built a small community. Generally, we talk through the eToro newsfeed, Twitter or my Discord server. I also put out blog posts and YouTube videos to help ensure all of my copiers are well informed about what’s going on.Kevin Stanely: I communicate with them through the eToro platform in the comments thread on all the posts.8. A classic debate in the crypto community is whether the halving has already been priced into Bitcoin. What do you guys think?Jaynemesis: The halving is never fully priced in. If markets were that efficient, trading wouldn’t be possible.Kevin Stanely: Yes and no. Yes because every sophisticated investor in the crypto markets knows about the halving and uses that public information to factor into their models. But just because something is public info, it doesn’t mean that the rest of the world that doesn’t know about crypto is pricing it in.In other words, only less than 1% of the world is “in” crypto right now, so everyone else is discounting the effects of the halving. Ultimately, the majority of the world — and by that I mean the majority of the world’s money — is not pricing in the halving simply because they don’t know about it.9. Do you have any interesting or unusual investment strategies you can share with us?Jaynemesis: I trade not only crypto but also invest in stocks. I approach both in the same way: I seek out disruption. Disruptive technology, disruptive business models and disruptive people.Kevin Stanely: Have a system, and don’t trade on emotions. For example, one good system in my opinion is: “Sell half on a double.” Why? You enter a risk-free position at that point. Selling half on a double allows you to take out your principal investment and then invest with “house money,” helping to remove any sort of emotions from your investment decisions thereafter.10. Copy trading, in some form anyway, has been around for decades. What makes eToro so different?Jaynemesis: One thing I love about eToro is that there isn’t a crazy minimum for people to start copying. Not everyone has $10 million lying around to invest in a good hedge fund! On eToro, you get the performance of a managed portfolio even if you’re only copying with $200. It’s super accessible and an easy place for people to learn to trade and invest by copying people and learning from their strategies.It’s also an amazing community. You usually don’t get that flowing conversation with a fund manager, but on eToro, you can really engage with other traders and investors, share ideas and learn from each other.Kevin Stanely: EToro has an amazing customer support team with very quick response times, which is a rarity in crypto. Moreover, it has crypto assets as well as stocks to invest in on one platform.It also has an awesome “virtual” trading platform for people new to the market who want to get their feet wet before they put real money at risk. EToro is a brokerage that has been around for 13 years, has over 13 million registered users and has an overall untarnished reputation.Disclaimer.

476,"The stock price of Tesla (TSLA) surpassed $1,200 in pre-market, achieving a market capitalization of over $220 billion. Now, the most valuable car company in the world is worth 30% more than the entire market cap of Bitcoin (BTC), the biggest and most popular cryptocurrency in the world. Tesla overtook Toyota to become the highest-valued car manufacturer in the global market. It now looks to establish its dominance in the sector as its stock continues to soar.The stock price of Tesla surpassed $1,200 in pre-market. Source: CNBCAccording to data from the Nasdaq exchange, Tesla officially hit $1,214 with an 8.5% increase in stock price. Analysts mainly attribute the uptrend of TSLA to the expectations of high Q2 sales Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, said he is amazed by the execution of the company. He told the employees in an email:“Just amazing how well you executed, especially in such difficult times. I am so proud to work with you!”The positive sentiment of Musk around Q2 led analysts to be optimistic towards a potentially profitable quarter. Electrek, an energy-focused publication, estimated that Tesla could have delivered upwards of 90,000 cars in the second quarter.Following the rally of Tesla, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he now expects the stock price of Tesla to hit $2,000 in the long-term. Ives said in a note:""We believe with demand for Model 3's ramping stronger than expectations in China heading into the summer timeframe, the lockdown easing in the US/Europe, and some potentially “game-changing” battery developments on the horizon that Tesla's stock likely has room to run further.”Other major stocks like Apple and Microsoft have maintained their momentum in recent months, buoyed by optimism in the U.S. stock market.While Tesla and Bitcoin have no price correlation or any similarity, the valuation of Tesla shows two things about the top cryptocurrency. First, Bitcoin is still at an extremely early phase of growth, and as such, has a large potential to grow further. Second, the uptrend of equities despite clear geopolitical and macro risks may positively affect risk-on assets in the third quarter.Throughout the first half of 2020, Tesla consistently ranked as one of the most shorted stocks in the U.S. Based on the data from the Nasdaq exchange, it remains as a heavily-shorted stock to this date.Most viewed stocks in Nasdaq’s short interest list. Source: NasdaqSimilarly, when the price of Bitcoin saw massive rallies in 2019, it was primarily triggered by a squeeze of short contracts. In July 2019, as an example, BTC rose to $14,000 from around $6,000 within a span of months. It was shorted aggressively on BitMEX, and as BTC moved upwards, it liquidated many short contracts.The Tesla stock is portraying a FOMO rally as Bitcoin did in previous years. As TSLA surges past its record high price, the chances of price discovery rise as it moves into uncharted territory."
477,"Multi-platform blockchain explorer Blockchair has added a “privacy-o-meter” for every Bitcoin (BTC) transaction that identifies which part is the change.This is the key to tracing a chain of transactions on the blockchain. While the Bitcoin blockchain is theoretically transparent, in practice it can be hard to identify the true flow of funds. Unless the wallet is drained completely, every transaction includes at least two unspent transaction outputs (UTXO), where one of them is returned to the sender as change.Blockchair uses several basic and advanced heuristics to assign a privacy score. For example, in a low privacy transaction one of the recipient addresses is also a sender, which makes it trivial to understand which is the change. If one of the outputs is a round number, it is also likely to be the recipient of the transaction.The system also analyzes technical clues like the type of the multi-sig that was used, the differences in script between inputs and outputs, as well as their ordering.Identifying these factors is the basis behind blockchain monitoring systems provided by companies like Chainalysis, Elliptic, CipherTrace, Coinfirm and others.The company thus hopes to educate users on how to send Bitcoi without exposing themselves too easily. Analysis techniques have grown in sophistication over time. This led to the creation of the CoinJoin protocol, which mixes Bitcoin by aggregating outputs from different users and redistributing them to fresh wallets. This privacy protocol has been steadily gaining usage since 2019 and reached new peaks in 2020. This is largely attributed to two wallets, Samourai and Wasabi, that provided a valid alternative to centralized mixing services.But while this approach can improve privacy, using it incorrectly can also leave clues for researchers to deanonymize transactions. PlusToken, one of the biggest crypto Ponzi schemes, saw more than 50% of its proceeds tracked to Chinese over-the-counter markets, despite using the most advanced obfuscation techniques available.While the large amounts involved made tracking easier, researchers demonstrated a set of heuristics that could compromise mixing on Ethereum. Though they noted that UTXO-based currencies can be more private, they believe the difference is not so significant to make tracking CoinJoin impossible.Even privacy-by-default coins like Monero (XMR) can have instances where extra attention is needed to guarantee privacy — for example through the practice of “churning,” or sending transactions to oneself.It appears that improper usage can make or break a privacy tool, making user education key."
478,"YouTube’s bans on crypto-related content has been problematic for the industry and is spurring demand for decentralized alternatives.However, according to Wes Levitt, head of strategy at Theta Labs — the firm behind Theta.tv — both YouTube and decentralized platforms can co-exist. YouTube is increasingly banning crypto-related content. In April, Jason Appleton, known as Crypto Crow, was banned from YouTube briefly. In May, Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin halving Livestream was canceled abruptly.Levitt told Cointelegraph, “We definitely see this censorship of crypto content as a problem, and we've recently welcomed several crypto streamers onto Theta.tv platform as a result. A fully decentralized platform will become inevitable as more streamers get banned from YouTube and other major platforms.”At the same time, Levitt doesn’t think YouTube will be fully replaced by decentralized alternatives: “I don't think a fully decentralized platform will necessarily replace YouTube; some content types will probably remain better suited for a centralized platform. But a decentralized alternative can co-exist alongside YouTube, to give streamers and viewers more freedom to choose their content platforms online.” Theta runs Theta.tv, a crypto-powered streaming service broadcasting esports, poker tournaments, and major blockchain and cryptocurrency conferences including Consensus and the Crypto Asia Summit. Recently, Google Cloud, Binance, Blockchain Ventures and gumi Cryptos were announced as Enterprise Validators for the Theta network.Last month, Theta announced a strategic partnership with gumi Cryptos to enter Japan’s $3 billion content market. Levitt revealed that they are aiming to whitelist the firm's THETA and TFUEL tokens with the Financial Services Agency.  In Japan, only whitelisted tokens approved by FSA can be traded at crypto exchanges. There are currently only 26 whitelisted tokens in Japan. Levitt said they would be “looking to launch integrations with video streaming platforms in Japan, allowing users in Japan to earn TFUEL token rewards for watching and sharing their favorite video content.”"

As Fauci issued this warning, stocks reacted with caution and investors are anticipating that a downturn in equities markets may lead to a correction in Bitcoin (BTC) price.Fauci also cautioned that an effective vaccine may not arrive as quickly as the medical community expects.

RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina said:“The numbers are sort of all over the place.”While strategists remain uncertain about the near-term trend of stocks, the demand for cash and safe-haven assets is increasing.According to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), bank deposits increased by $2 trillion during the pandemic. It indicates that investors are increasingly moving away from high-risk assets to mitigate risk.Brian Foran, an analyst at Autonomous Research, said:“A lot of banks are saying, `There’s frankly not much we can do with it right now.’ They have more deposits than they know what to do with.”A continuous rise in investors’ appetite for cash and declining demand for risk-on assets may lead to a Bitcoin market slump.It is not just the traditional financial market that is seeing an increase in cash savings. Tether (USDT), the most dominant stablecoin in the crypto market, recently surpassed $10 billion in market capitalization.Depending on how the data is interpreted, the sharp increase in Tether’s valuation may mean an increase in the capital that’s waiting on the sidelines to get into Bitcoin.Despite the growing amount of cash in the financial market and in crypto, both stocks and Bitcoin have consolidated in recent months. Almost immediately after the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve contracted, stocks and crypto assets fell simultaneously.The trend suggests that investors are waiting for additional economic data and more insight into how the U.S. economy will respond to the resurgence of the coronavirus. The reluctance of market participants engaging with risk-on assets could possibly lead to increased selling pressure on BTC in the near-term."
480,"Bitcoin (BTC), in fact, crushed stock markets during the Covid-19 recovery with equity “growth” simply down to inflation, fresh data argues.Charts showing stocks denominated in gold and Bitcoin in 2020 show that far from having their best quarter in ten years, markets had no “recovery” at all.The perspective is starkly different to the message coming from governments and mainstream media about the health of the economy.Central bank intervention, they claim, helped boost stocks to clinch their strongest quarterly growth since 2011 in Q2. But when viewed in BTC, however, Q2 gains from the March crash are simply a modest bounce against a much longer, more serious downtrend.In January, the S&P 500 traded at around 0.45 BTC, with this decreasing until mid-March when a sudden spike to 0.5 BTC occurred. Thereafter, a drop below 0.3 BTC in May spelled the end of any real U-turn, with current levels circling 0.33 BTC.S&P 500/BTC year-to-date chart.

As noted this week, central banks’ economic policies worldwide have resulted in interest rate cuts and much cheaper money. At the same time, particularly in the case of the United States, central banks have commandeered macro markets.The result has been a curiously strong performance against a backdrop of a huge spike in unemployment and more global debt than ever before.Macro asset returns in 2020.

481,"Prominent members of the crypto community continue to express skepticism over the stock-to-flow, or S2F, chart, a Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction model recently revised by analyst PlanB. Nico Cordeiro, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at crypto quant fund Strix Leviathan, called S2F a “chameleon,” a term from Stanford professor Paul Pleifderer describing models built upon dubious assumptions. “The model’s accuracy will likely be about as successful at forecasting Bitcoin’s future price as the astrological models of the past were at predicting financial outcomes,” Cordeiro said. Cointelegraph reported on June 1 that PlanB had updated its signature chart, making it seem as though Bitcoin was on the cusp of a massive bull run leading to a $100,000 BTC price before the end of 2021. This was far from the $9,000–$10,000 range in which the token has remained for weeks. On July 1, analyst PlanB released a new red dot, indicating that two months have passed since the BTC rewards halving.  #Bitcoin S2F chart update .. RED DOT #2 🔴 pic.twitter.com/L8Fl89yNYxDespite its model failing to predict BTC price movements in June with significant accuracy, PlanB continues to update revised versions of the S2F model for its 114,900 Twitter followers. An S2F analysis treats BTC as a commodity comparable to gold, an asset with a fixed supply. This assumes new supplies — the amount mined — are insignificant when compared with the existing supply. PlanB applies this same logic to Bitcoin: more of the tokens available to be mined are diminished by halvings roughly every four years, with a total supply fixed at 21 million BTC. Cordeiro has refuted the basis of the S2F model, saying it relies on the assertion that the United States dollar market capitalization of a commodity like gold is derived directly from its rate of new supply. According to its chief information officer, PlanB has not provided any evidence to support this idea. He also used statistical analyses that result “in a high probability of a researcher finding spurious results.”PlanB has responded to Cordeiro’s accusations on Twitter, saying he used “old and refuted” arguments for his claims. Though Cordeiro admits the S2F chart has achieved “viral popularity,” he attributes its success to Bitcoin enthusiasts hopeful for bulls, even calling out PlanB directly, “I forgot the accuracy of a model is dependent on the number of Twitter followers a researcher has.”The CIO isn’t alone in his skepticism. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has asserted that the idea that Bitcoin halvings are creating price rallies is “unfalsifiable.”“Investors should be highly skeptical of this model even if they believe Bitcoin is digital gold,” Cordeiro says. “The SF paper is not proper empirical analysis, but more akin to a marketing piece in which the author is trying to convince readers that Bitcoin is going to be worth a lot more tomorrow. This may or may not turn out true, but it has little to do with Bitcoin’s supply schedule.” "

On July 1, 2020, Bill Burr and Bert Kreischer kicked off a historic 18-month Bitcoin bull market.”Pompliano, aka Pomp, had just finished educating the duo on how banks are unable to provide more than $250,000 in protection from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for some accounts. Burr, who has a net worth of roughly $12 million, risks losing a lot of money should a bank fold, unless his fiat assets were highly spread out. The comedian took aim at “unqualified” bankers using his money to turn a profit, claiming they inflated the housing market. “You create this whole f----ing bubble and when the whole thing goes to s--- you still get a f---ing bonus and you’re only gonna give me 250 off my million bucks? How is that f---ing legal? I’m getting Bitcoin! f--- this s---!”The duo quizzed Pomp on almost everything financial, from legacy systems and inflation to the history of cryptocurrency back to Satoshi. Though not shying away from using financial lingo, Pomp kept his analogies simple, explaining distributed ledgers as a game of Monopoly in which everyone tracks the money.Eventually the conversation turned practical, with the pair asking about the current price — $9,232 at the time of writing — and how crypto is held. Pomp even proposed Burr consider adding Bitcoin as an option for payments for his comedy shows, while Kreischer also expressed an interest in mining the cryptocurrency.Responses from viewers were generally positive at the trio’s exchange.“Pomp explains BTC to two wisecracking comedians so well that they’re genuinely fascinated,” said Twitter user Jeffcrow.Redditor /u/Peter4real also credited the Bitcoin educator for explaining the concept to Burr: “He is being critical but trying to understand that there’s something rotten in the economy that affects everybody except the rich.”However, being comedians, Burr and Bert took the time to make Pomp chuckle on a number of occasions with statements including “Bitcoin is like Cardi B: you’ve heard of her, but never heard of her songs.” Burr threw out the name of a person he invented at the Fed when challenged on his knowledge, which nearly caused Pomp to fall out of his chair laughing.I’m calling it now.

485,"On June 30, a Russian criminal court denied a motion to provide restitution to a victim of what would in many jurisdictions be a felony, arguing that Bitcoin (BTC), as a virtual currency, does not enjoy the same property protection as other assets.The case goes back to 2018, when the two men impersonating Federal Security Service (FSB) agents and their accomplices kidnapped the victim and forced him into giving them 5 million rubles or $90,000 in cash and 99.7 BTC — worth about $900,000 at the time. The kidnappers were sentenced to eight- and ten-year prison sentences. As part of the criminal proceedings, the victim requested the court rule to force the thieves to repay the funds that they stole from him. The court ruled partially in the victim’s favor, asserting the thieves must repay the 5 million rubles. However, when it came to the cryptocurrency, the court declared that it is unable to satisfy the claim, since virtual currencies are not recognized by Russia’s laws as legal tender or its surrogate.The victim may still try his luck in a civil court. Regardless of any future legal proceedings, this court decision is remarkable — in essence, it declared that Bitcoin theft is not a crime."

487,"A new ransomware is targeting macOS users who download installers for popular apps via torrent files.Known as EvilQuest, the attack was first spotted by Dinesh Devadoss, a K7 Lab malware researcher. Findings show that EvilQuest has been quite active since the start of June 2020. Malware lab firms, like Malwarebytes, have found the ransomware attached to pirated macOS software distributed mainly through torrent sites and warez forums.EvilQuest asks victims to pay a ransom through the same static Bitcoin (BTC) address in every documented attack. One of the first signs that EvilQuest has deployed an attack is that MacOS Finder freezes. Once file encryption is complete, a text file is generated with ransom instructions.Speaking with Cointelegraph, Brett Callow, threat analyst and ransomware expert at malware lab, Emsisoft, believes that EvilQuest is unlikely to be anything other than a very small-scale threat:“The fact that Macs have a relatively small market share means they’re not a particularly attractive target for ransomware groups and they’re unlikely to invest significant resources in targeting Mac users.”Findings also show that the average ransom demanded by the attackers is $50 worth in BTC. Victims are usually given a deadline of 72 hours to pay.Callow adds:“That said, a threat is a threat and it’s something Mac-users should be aware of. Thankfully, as this ransomware appears to be targeted exclusively via pirated software, it’s very easily avoided simply by not using pirated software. That holds true whether you’re a Mac user or a Windows user: pirated software and cracks are the primary distribution method for the types of ransomware that target home users.”Recently, Cointelegraph reported on the rise in ransomware that targets home users rather than companies."
